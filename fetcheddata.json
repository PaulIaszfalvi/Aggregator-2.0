Our [FAQ][faq] covers many common questions; check that first. Also try searching old posts, either [via google][google] or via reddit's search.\n3. Your question isn't answered in the FAQ? Please read the following:\n\n## Getting debugging help\n\nIf your question is about code, make sure it's **specific** and **provides all information up-front**. Here's a checklist of what to include:\n\n1. A [**concise but descriptive title**][debugging-title].\n2. A [**good description**][debugging-description] of the problem.\n4.  A [**minimal**, **easily runnable**][debugging-posting], and [**well-formatted**][debugging-formatting] program that demonstrates your problem.\n5. The output you expected and what you got instead. If you got an error, include the **full** error message.\n\nDo your best to solve your problem before posting. The quality of the answers will be proportional to the amount of effort you put into your post. Note that title-only posts are automatically removed.\n\nAlso see [our full posting guidelines][debugging] and the [subreddit rules][rules]. After you post a question, **DO NOT** delete it!\n\n## Asking conceptual questions\n\nAsking conceptual questions is ok, but please check [our FAQ][faq] and search older posts first.\n\nIf you plan on asking a question similar to one in the FAQ, explain what exactly the FAQ didn't address and clarify what you're looking for instead. See our full guidelines on [asking conceptual questions][conceptual] for more details.\n\n## Subreddit rules\n\nPlease read [our rules][rules] and [other policies][policies] before posting.

I did not do anything incredible on linux ( TOP, I believe mostly recommends it because of compatibility issues with Ruby on rails and others ) all I learned was the usual cd/ls/touch to start up a project quickly. ( and other basics like filesystem differences with windows and whatnot ) All I programmed was in vs code, did not use vim or anything.\nI have since changed laptops and the one I have now has a smaller SSD. I do not want to entirely switch to linux and I don't feel like dual booting again, also the laptop is a tad weak for a smooth VM experience.\nMy question is as follows: what is the point lf doing everything in linux? I have skimmed a few threads, most people mention how most web servers are in linux and go on to describe complicated things they had to do at work that I don't really understand at this point. But right now I'm mostly just working on web apps that are ( apparently ) cross platform, I don't really learn much of linux while working in it, and I don't know that I can learn of all those common working world use cases working on my own localhost apps.\nAny thoughts/recommendations?",

More recently I have been trying to get into the habit of using Git as intended and committing my changes (even though I'm the only one working on the code).\n\nSome of the automations have been successful for my team (I have been providing them with scripts) and my manager is interested in having other team members start helping me.  These team members would also not be developers and I am realizing it will be very important to use Git.\n\nCurrently all I use is git status, git add, git commit and git push.\n\nI would like to review any changes team members are trying to make to the Bitbucket repos but not sure of the best way to accomplish this in a team environment.  I created a second Bitbucket account and messed around with the permissions but I am still not sure.\n\nFrom what I can see, I will need to give them ReadOnly access as it seems any other level would allow them to push directly.  Once they have permission to the repo in my Bitbucket, what would they do on their machine/in their Bitbucket account to make changes and create a pull request?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

In August, I was informed that I was receiving a promotion to Senior Software Engineer, which I was pleased with as it was something I had been working hard to achieve. I was told that in line with the company's salary bands, I would receive a salary increase to £78k annually, which exceeded my expectations and left me over the moon.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, since then, whenever I've questioned the status of the promotion, I've been told that it's awaiting approval from higher-ups or that there's red tape blocking the promotion. Today, I finally received an email titled 'Signature Request - Promotion Letter.' Eagerly, I opened it and saw that the salary offered as part of the promotion was now £65k.\r  \n\r  \nI immediately raised this concern with my manager and learned that HR had blocked a series of promotions, including my own, due to their unwillingness to meet the salary demands outlined in their salary bands. They eventually agreed to a lower salary after facing significant pushback from my manager and his boss.\r  \n\r  \nNaturally, I was disappointed and asked my manager to convey this to HR. I know it may not change anything, but I believe it's important that they understand how people feel about their decision. Had I initially been offered the salary of £65k, I would have been content, but it didn't sit right with me to dangle a larger carrot only to effectively retract it. What frustrated me the most was that my manager informed me he had requested the new salary be backdated to August when I was originally told about the promotion, but HR refused.\r  \n\r  \nI now find myself in a position where I should be grateful and happy about receiving a promotion, but I'm left with a rather bitter taste in my mouth. In the past, I've always changed roles to secure significant salary increases, but I had planned to settle down in this role for the foreseeable future. However, I'm now harboring major doubts and already browsing LinkedIn.\r  \n\r  \nIt's a very fresh situation, and I won't make any immediate rash decisions.

So if someone was on a project, they'd only attend that project's standup and not the home team's since they have no updates to share regarding the home team work.\n\nNow, we have different management and they've decided to change this all up and require devs to attend both sets of SCRUM meetings, even if their only update is \"not actively working on this project.\" They say it's to increase visibility of what devs are doing to their managers, as home team managers would often not know what the dev assigned to the project is doing day-by-day since those tickets are on a different sprint board and run by different leads.\n\nTo me this seems unnecessary. I try to only attend meetings that I can contribute to. To sit in an additional 30 minute standup each day just to say some form of \"no updates from me, still working on task that is not relevant to any of you that likely sounds like gibberish since you all have no context.\" \n\nThe standups are at least 30 minutes each and are at different times of the day, so one in the morning and one in the afternoon, which is even worse as my flow state gets disrupted twice in one day. This doesn't even factor in the other scrum meetings like retros, sprint planning, etc which can each easily be an hour long. \n\nIs this normally what happens at other companies?

          "user": "MythicalStrength",
          "score": 90,
          "selftext": "Howdy redditors,\n\nI’ve competed in another strongman competition, this time my first time as a Lightweight Male in the 181lb class.  I’ll cut to the chase and say I came in dead last and zero’d more events than I’d ever done before.  I’ve dropped 35lbs since March, and I’m still adjusting to my new body in that regard, which helped make this one of the most challenging competitions of my life.  I’m pretty excited in that regard, and thought I’d share the experience.\n\nIf you want to read about the training/nutrition leading up to it, check [here](http://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/)\n\nAnd for video of the full comp, check [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM4rfc9xAD8)\n\n**PRE-COMP**\n\nI ate the same breakfast I’ve been having every training day: 150g of egg whites mixed with 150g of beef bone broth with 1.5 scoops of Metabolic Drive and some powdered electrolytes.  A wild departure from my days of eating…nothing, so I could make weight, followed by some sort of sugary/fast food blitz.  I drove an uneventful 2.25 hours to the site and weighed in at 173.0 while wearing full sweats, shoes, and my strongman compression gear underneath.  \n\nI set-up camp and actually dug into one of my meals before the first event: 4 hardboiled whole pasture raised organic eggs mashed into a paste with a serving of grassfed sour cream and 4oz (cooked) of ground venison, personally hunted and butchered by my wife’s Uncle.  Another departure from my glory days, which I’ll address next, but it was also weird being so hungry when I hadn’t done anything yet.  \n\n**GOALS**\n\nSince I knew I was super behind the 8-ball on this due to my bodyweight, this was going to be a different kind of comp for me: this was about personal growth.  My goals were to not eat any junk OR carbs and keep it as carnivore as possible.  Not because I felt like this was more noble, but more to simply see if I could, and how it would go.  The Metabolic Drive was the closest “exception” and I packed an emergency Finibar in case I found myself crashing, but otherwise it was just going to be that mashed egg/venison mixture, green tea and water.  \n\nI also was going to go limited caffeine: only the stuff in the green tea.  I have a 3 week streak without energy drinks of coffee going, and I wanna see how long I can keep it going.  Again: no particular reason, just to see if I could.  In the past, I’d be about 2-3 energy drinks deep by the end of the day.  Did I “need” that?\n\nThe third goal was to not re-tear whatever it was I tore in my right knee on week 2 of “Juggeryoke”.  The first event was where I was most worried about that, since I did it on the log, but I was going to keep my eye on it all competition.\n\nAnd final goal was to leave it all out there and have fun.  It’s the whole reason I signed up.\n\n**EVENT 1: 200lb Log Clean and Press Each Rep**\n\nI was excited about this event, since cleaning each rep is awesome and gasses competitors.  Then I got to actually handle the log we were going to use and realized this was going to be a “ WHO can get a rep” contest for the lightweights.  The log handles were STUPID far apart, like the Rogue 10”.  \n\nFirst guy got the clean but no rep.  Second guy got in 2 of the grandest reps of all time with a jerk and a JPS-esque “press the log off the head” technique. \n\nI got set, got my head right, grabbed the log, went to clean it, felt it feel like a jillion pounds, got stuck midway, somehow through sheer force of will get it all the way to my chest…and knew that there was absolutely no way I was going to press it.  I let it crash, thinking that, if I could do better on another clean and not be so exhausted, I might be able to set up for a stronger press.  Well, that didn’t happen, and I didn’t want to re-tear my left bicep on an errant log clean, so after a few more attempts, I hung it up.  The guy after me got a jillion reps and was the clear candidate for first that day.\n\n**EVENT 2: Max Trap Bar in 3 attempts**\n\nI had been doing a ROM progression cycle on trap bar with 405lbs, so I knew I was good for that.  We were allowed to pick the starting weight in the rules meeting, so I asked for 400, knowing we’d go 20lb jumps from there.\n\nThe guy who also zero’d the log ended up asking for us to start with 380, and he missed that, so I knew if I got 400 I at least had a win there.  400 was grindy, but made it.  We were apparently pulling on the Eleiko Oppen bar, which was cool since it had knurl marks on the center of the handle, which made strapping in easy.  I had an issue with strapping in too far forward or backward in training and having the bar tilt.\n\nNo other MLWs went for 400, the next time one jumped in was at 460, so I went for that to match too.  460 felt WAY too damn heavy, but I pulled it.  Since we were doing “Rising Bar”, I decided to pass on 480 to allow me some recovery time, and asked for 500.  I really liked Rising bar for the strategic element of it, and it made a last man standing event tolerable.  I actually felt 500 ever so slightly start to break off the floor, but not enough to be worth chasing after.  My knee was holding up strong so far, and this was keeping it in place.\n\n**EVENT 3: Sandbag and sled drag**\n\nThis and the 4th event are why I signed up: medleys in a competition.  I missed these so much.  Unlike previous comps, I did ZERO sandbag training to prep for this, which was for the best, because I usually end up tearing the hell out of my arms when I do that.  \n\nI used some strongman cheating and put the sandbag on top of my feet as part of my set-up.  This gives a little bit of daylight between the floor and the bag, which allows for handholds.  I also ditched my competition shirt at this point and decided I was going to go for the Mariusz Pudzianowski/Jon Andersen Award for “Most Jacked Person at the Competition”, because if  can’t be the strongest at least I can look pretty while I lose.  You can actually hear some folks making commentary about it during this event.\n\nThe sandbag pick actually went pretty well, and the carry moved about as fast as I would expect with so minimal training.  The sled drag caught me off guard: about the only clue it was going to be so awful was watching the other competitors attempting the sled and being caught off guard.  So I went for the initial pull, realized it was going to be heavy as hell, and just leaned into it and pulled like hell, knowing that, if I ever stopped, I’d be dead.  Just like a shark.\n\nI was surprised when I ran out of time.  I felt like I was moving at a good pace.  I had a slight technical error getting set up on the straps, and I lost a little bit of time on the bag, but ultimately I imagine I needed to move faster on the sled.\n\nBut I think this was the first time I had a sled in a comp where I didn’t fall backwards on my butt, so that’s a win.  This got me a last place finish.\n\n**EVENT 4: Duckwalk and powerstairs**\n\nEvent was supposed to be duck walk 25’, do 3 reps of power stairs, then duckwalk it back.\n\nLotta dudes were struggling with those stairs, and I figured out where: those WIDE 100lb plates pretty much give you no opportunity to hinge.  I’m only 5’9, so I’m already sawed off as it is, but now that I have to take a sumo stance I was totally hosed.  \n\nBut also, you might be able to tell in the video: I about blacked out on the initial pick, and was basically jump zombie-ing forward until I went night-night.  I managed to fall forward, have the stars clear, do a quick pick and repeat.  I fell into the platform, corrected myself, and struggled futilely to get it to the platform.  But I gave it some solid effort, and loading my frame down with 100lbs over bodyweight was awesome for making every muscle in my body pop, so I got a cool facebook photo.  This, once again, got me last place.\n\n**EVENT 5: Stone Medley**\n\nI won’t bother listing weights and heights here, because as you saw on the video, it was a big goose egg.  This is the only event I have a bitter taste in my mouth about.  You might be able to see it in the video, but I was literally GLUED to the stone.  I applied a moderate amount of tack to myself, but the stone ITSELF was COATED in tacky from previous competitors, to the point that it was stuck to the platform.  So it didn’t matter about being strong enough to pick up the stone: I had to be strong enough to BREAK the tacky off the stone first and THEN pick it up, and then, once I got it lapped, it wasn’t going anywhere else.  With how high the platform was, my plan was to try to shoulder it, but I could never even get the momentum necessary, because it was like trying to walk through mud: each movement was about getting unstuck and then stuck again.\n\nI realized at that point I’m a dinosaur in the sport: everyone else is using tacky shirts and stone sleeves and, in turn, has material that can help by pass the tacky issue, while I’m just applying sticky stuff to my body.  I the future, I think I’m just going to avoid tackying myself and just rely on what’s on the stone.  Zero’d here.\n\nI will say that I got another great strongman win here: as I was standing there, bare chested and covered in tacky, another dude who was going that route was standing next to me.  He was definitely more “strongman built”.  He looked at me, there was a pause, and then he “Dude..are you, like, bodybuilding?”\n\nI replied with “Nope: just not eating enough”.\n\nHe appreciated that.  Told me I was definitely the leanest dude there, and I said “Well at least I won that”. \n\n**LESSONS LEARNED**\n\nI knew coming in this light was going to be a challenge, and it delivered.  Doing no specific training for the comp also added to that.  But, that’s really the big thing: I grew up.  Strongman isn’t my life anymore: it’s a thing I do for fun.  And that’s absolutely what happened: I had a blast and I DIDN’T have to change my life for it.  I kept training the week of the comp, went for a 3 mile walk with my family after it was done (and after having an AMAZING dinner at our favorite BBQ place where I got the biggest, fattest pork ribs I’d ever seen in my life alongside some amazing sliced brisket) and just treated this like it was an events day.  I intend to keep it this way: if a comp looks fun, I’ll sign up and have a blast.  And I got to help out some folks along the way: the guy who took second in my weight class cramped up BAD, so I gave him some of the electrolytes I brought and it totally transformed him.  I also let him use some of the goo gone and paper towels I brought for tacky removal and got him sold of WD-40.  And I got to meet a few awesome folks off reddit as well.  A dude named John (went by u/ifrankthepug back in the day) introduced himself to me: “Dude, are you MythicalStrength?  I’ve been reading your articles for 6 years!”  That was really cool, and honestly was one of the highlights of the competition.\n\nGot to meet up with u/eric_twinge as well.  Was awesome getting to put a face to the name.\n\n**WHAT’S NEXT**\n\nWell, about that: I originally had a competition signed up for 14 Oct…but I just went looking for it and it’s gone: instead, having been moved to 4 Nov.  That’s a less viable date for me, and currently I’m the only person in the 181 weight class, so there’s very little incentive to go do it compared to just a hard events day at home.  I have a 5k signed up for 15 Oct, and then I go for a Disney Cruise on 16 Oct.  So now that I don’t have a competition looming, I’m probably going to do 2 more weeks of Juggeryoke with a few movement alterations leading up to the cruise and most likely do a mini-famine there so that I can absolutely eat my face off the whole time I’m cruising.  After that?  Chaos is the Plan.  But I’ll be at this weight class for the next competition, whenever that happens.",

          "user": "MythicalStrength",
          "score": 97,
          "selftext": "JUGGERYOKE REVIEW\n\n**INTRO AND BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT**\n\n* These tend to run stupidly long whenever I write them and I’m going to try to not let that happen, since I also am already in the middle of writing up my competition report (writing the pre-stuff before the comp and will detail the comp when it happens) wherein I ALREADY speak about this program…but already I’m writing too much.\n\n* But allow me to start with the conclusion: this program is awesome, like most of Jamie Lewis’ programs.  It looks daunting until you finally do it, and then you realize the genius built into it.  It has my approval, and I highly recommend people pick it up alongside the “Feast/Famine/Ferocity” bundle [here]( https://plagueofstrength.com/the-feast-famine-and-ferocity-diet-is-now-updated-and-available-as-an-e-book/).  \n\n**WHAT IS JUGGERYOKE**\n\n* Jamie sums it up as “the traptastic YuggerYoke Protocol V 3.0, a 3 page pdf of a super trap-heavy full-body training program that will appeal to strongmen, powerlifters, and anyone trying to look like a Marvel superhero.”  I assumed this was a 6 week program, since Jamie says in the document “After 6 weeks of this, you should be ready for the beach, looking like a lost member of the X-Men.”, but in the actual Juggeryoke link it says “This product is not a book- it’s a 3 page PDF specialization program designed to be used for 8 weeks to quickly bring up your yoke area (traps and shoulders).”  Whelp, I’m finishing the 6th week right now and writing my review but I DO intend to carry it forward for the next 2 weeks as I prep for a follow on comp on 14 Oct…so maybe I’ll write about that too.  Chaos is the plan.\n\n* Jamie has a 5-6 day and a 3-4 day variant of the program in the book, similar to what he did with “Feast, Famine and Ferocity”, which turned out to a positive for me while I ran it.\n\n**PROGRAM OVERVIEW**\n\n* I won’t give away the full programs, [although I DID take video of every single workout and you could most likely piece it together from that]( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfcuGAffLlSe6Uwn7B4yaY6zDq1cs3TfV), but still: please buy the program and support Jamie.  \n\n* I primarily ran the 5-6 day variant, which is effectively 3 full body workouts with an arm day in between each day for a total of 5 directed workouts and a 6th one wherein you can do whatever you want (similar to the “Dealer’s Choice” from Feast/Famine/Ferocity).  The 3-4 day variant takes those 2 arm workouts and merges them into the 3 full body days, along with a bit more exercise shuffling, and gives a bit more guidance on what to do on the 4th day as a gap filler.\n\n* The program requires training without a belt and a daily 1.5 mile walk, both of which are awesome.  It includes front squatting and squatting, push pressing and strict pressing, touch and go benching and pause benching, high pulls and HEAVY shrugs, ab wheel and hanging leg raises with lat shrugs, squat singles, triples and squatting for time.  That final bit was definitely my “favorite” part of the program.  1-2 sets of 2-3 minutes of squatting with 135lbs on your back.  I, of course, opted for 2 sets of 3 minutes and used 1 minute of rest between, and made it a goal to hit a new rep PR each week.  That was a fantastic challenge.\n\n**MY DEVIATIONS**\n\n* When I run a program the first time, I like to stick with it pretty close, BUT I also picked Juggeryoke in particular because it would allow me to include some movements that would benefit me for my upcoming competition.  So in that regard: I used a strongman log for my push pressing work, an axle for all my other pressing (bench, incline and strict), same axle for most of my skull crushers and reverse curls, grenade balls with chains for more of my arm work, and a trap bar for my high pulls and my shrugs.  Also, on the day where I was to do 15x1 squats, I often would lower the bar weight and use chains instead.  This was primarily due to sustaining a slight knee injury in the second week of the program during log clean and push press.  I moved a bit too quickly and possibly tore a meniscus.  By the end of the program it was feeling better, but it still seemed to work well to limit loading at the bottom of the rep and increase it toward the top.  Besides: Dan John said that, if he had to do it all over again, he’d always squat with chains, so good enough.\n\n* I took to adding a set of Poundstone curls at the end of one of the arm days, just for even more pump, and would throw in band pull aparts and lateral raises where I could find space for it.\n\n* For my 6th day, I ran through a ROM progression cycle of trap bar mat pulls, since I had a max trap bar lift coming up in my competition.  This was ultimately a 5 minute workout that I would frequently do without a warm-up.  After lifting was finished on each day, if I had any extra time, I’d do some short intense conditioning work.  I’d also do some sort of strongman training on Sundays: some sort of carry and load of some variety.  \n\n* On the 3rd week of the program, my schedule got compromised, so I ran the 3 day variant, and on the 6th week (current) my competition was at the end of the week, so I dropped my lifts back to their starting point and made it a point to move these (now) lighter weights fast and with short reps, as something of a mini-deload.  I actually think these might be good intentional decisions in the future.  They’re tools in the toolbox if nothing else.\n\n**WHAT I LIKED**\n\n* As much as I genuinely didn’t care for the arm days (I get up at the crack of dawn to train, and its hard to get motivated to do that when it’s JUST arms…), they are honestly a brilliant touch in the program overall, because they effectively give you an active recovery day between the BRUTALLY hard full body workouts.  I would be incredibly sore from the previous day, but wake up knowing I “just gotta do arms”, and then, by the next day, I was ready to train again.  And one of those arm days includes 20 minutes of non-stop bodyweight work, which I used as an opportunity to do burpee chins, which did a great job of getting some restorative bloodflow to the sore muscles and a touch of conditioning.\n\n* The timed squats are just plain awesome.  The weight is light and it encourages PR chasing, to say nothing of the lactic acid threshold benefit and the sheer anabolism that comes with it.  It’s also another great break between one day of heavy front squat triples and one day of heavy squat singles.  \n\n* On that, the variety of rep ranges and movements in general is just intelligent and awesome.  This is typical Jamie Lewis “Chaos and Pain” training: a great break if you’ve been doing the same thing for a while.  And since I was coming off of “Easy Strength”, that’s exactly what was happening.\n\n* HANGING LAT SHRUGS.  Oh my god that makes SO much sense.  You do 10 lat shrugs at the end of every set of hanging leg raises you do, and lat shrugs from a hang are so much more intuitive than trying to do them with dumbbells/barbells.  This is giving Paul Kelso his proper due.  And they’re very restorative.  Jamie does a great job of forcing me to do the things I SHOULD be doing, and that includes these lat shrugs, alongside all the direct arm and ab work.\n\n**WHAT I WOULD CHANGE**\n\n* Jamie has an arm day where you are to do skull crushers and reverse curls as a superset, using the same weight.  Jamie either has the strongest biceps ever or the weakest triceps, but for me, a weight I can reverse curl is too light for skull crushers, and trying to make this work was just square peg/round hole for me.  I came up with a bunch of tricks, but ultimately, when I run this again, I give myself permission to just use 2 different set ups.\n\n* My next run, I’ll probably bring the Safety Squat Bar in for that day of heavy squat singles.  I feel like the SSB better fits the “Yoke” portion of Juggeryoke, given how much it hammers the upper back.  I’ll most likely do SSB front squats too, just because my front rack is jacked up after 6 shoulder dislocations and toward the end of the program I had to deal with bar slippage issues.  \n\n**RESULTS**\n\n* You can see my physique in all the training videos.  In general, I’m more filled out in the areas I was lacking, which is awesome.\n\n* This program was GREAT for my horizontal pressing, as funny as that seems.  I went from 225 to 255 on my pause benching, and my dips went from 105 to 120.  I also went from 77 squats to 90 with 135.  My burpee chins each week tended to climb up, front squats went from 185 to 220 for the 10x3, etc etc.  All of my lifts went up: the program worked.\n\n**NUTRITION**\n\n* Nothing specifically prescribed by the program, but during this time I was using the nutrition protocol I laid out [here](https://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/2023/06/nutritional-alchemy-nutrition-post-part.html), which included a 5 day “mini-famine” in the 5th week, which allowed me to eat VERY big in the 6th week…which might also just be a good approach.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\n* This program is awesome.  Please buy and run it.",

I've made pretty good progress all while losing body fat. My progress has stopped and I wanted to look into other options. The group training seems interesting since it's cheaper than normal 1 on 1 while still allowing you to interact with a coach albeit in a more limited capacity. I figured it might be a good middle ground. Have you used a simialr  service how has your exp been ?",

For those taking an extended period of time off from competing, why are you doing it?",

It's more pronounced in those on the taller side who likely realise that the number on the scale is going to have to ring a lot higher to catch up with their 5'5 buddy who is jacked at the same bodyweight.\n\nIt is true that some people can be really lean and have a great physique and big bench press in Powerlifting, but generally speaking the biggest benchers are in the upper weight classes and many of those lifters are carrying extra bodyfat in addition to lean mass.\n\nNobody wants to be fat,  but is there an alternative to breaking stubborn bench plateaus for people?",

There used to be outright Meccas of PL gyms, like Westside, or Quads, but the internet has made it so that anybody can train anywhere with good information. This is a good thing, but it does mean that the absolute best place to go for PL instruction or culture has become less clear. \n\nMy question for y’all is “what gyms in the US would you identify as the most culturally/athletically significant right now?” I know, for example, Madtown and Supertraining would be on the list, but where else?",
