        "selfText": "# Hello fellow programs!\n\n**tl;dr what should r/programming's rules be?** And also a call for additional mods. We'll leave this stickied for a few days to gather feedback.\n\nHere are the broad categories of content that we see, along with whether they are **currently** allowed. ‚úÖ means that it's currently allowed, üö´ means that it's not currently allowed, ‚ö†Ô∏è means that we leave it up if it is already popular but if we catch it young in its life we do try to remove it early.\n\n* ‚úÖ Actual programming content. They probably have actual code in them. Language or library writeups, papers, technology descriptions. How an allocator works. How my new fancy allocator I just wrote works. How our startup built our Frobnicator, rocket ship emoji. For many years this was the only category of allowed content.\n* ‚úÖ Programming news. ChatGPT can write code. A big new CVE just dropped. Curl 8.01 released now with Coffee over IP support.\n* ‚úÖ Programmer career content. How to become a Staff engineer in 30 days. Habits of the best engineering managers. How to deal with your annoying coworkers, *Jeff*.\n* ‚úÖ Articles/news interesting *to* programmers but not about programming. Work from home is bullshit. Return to office is bullshit. There's a Steam sale on programming games. Terry Davis has died. How to SCRUMM. App Store commissions are going up. How to hire a more diverse development team. Interviewing programmers is broken.\n* ‚ö†Ô∏è General technology news. Google buys its last competitor. A self driving car hit a pedestrian. Twitter is collapsing. Oculus accidentally showed your grandmother a penis. Github sued when Copilot produces the complete works of Harry Potter in a code comment. Meta cancels work from home. Gnome dropped a feature I like. How to run Stable Diffusion to generate pictures of, uh, cats, yeah it's definitely just for cats. A bitcoin VR metaversed my AI and now my app store is mobile social local.\n* üö´ Politics. The Pirate Party is winning in Sweden. Please vote for net neutrality. Big Tech is being sued in Europe for *gestures broadly*.\n* üö´ Gossip. Richard Stallman switches to Windows. Elon Musk farted. Linus Torvalds was a poopy-head on a mailing list. Grace Hopper Conference is now 60% male. The People's Rust Foundation is arguing with the Rust Foundation For The People. Terraform has been forked into Terra and Form. Stack Overflow sucks now. Stack Overflow is good actually.\n* ‚úÖ Demos with code. I wrote a game, here it is on GitHub\n* üö´ Demos without code. I wrote a game, come buy it! Please give me feedback on my startup (totally not an ad nosirree). I stayed up all night writing a commercial text editor, here's the pricing page. I made a DALL-E image generator. I made the fifteenth animation of A* this week, here's a GIF.\n* üö´ AskReddit type forum questions. What's your favourite programming language? Tabs or spaces? Does anyone else hate it when.\n* üö´ Support questions. How do I write a web crawler? How do I get into programming? Where's my missing semicolon? Please do this obvious homework problem for me. Personally I feel very strongly about not allowing these because they'd quickly drown out all of the actual content I come to see, and there are already much more effective places to get them answered anyway. In real life the quality of the ones that we see is also universally very low.\n* üö´ Surveys and üö´ Job postings and anything else that is looking to extract value from a place a lot of programmers hang out without contributing anything itself.\n* üö´ Meta posts. DAE think r/programming sucks? Why did you remove my post? Why did you ban this user that is totes not me I swear I'm just asking questions. Except this meta post. This one is okay because I'm a tyrant that the rules don't apply to (I assume you are saying about me to yourself right now).\n* üö´ Images, memes, anything low-effort or low-content. Thankfully we very rarely see any of this so there's not much to remove but like support questions once you have a few of these they tend to totally take over because it's easier to make a meme than to write a paper and also easier to vote on a meme than to read a paper.\n* ‚ö†Ô∏è Posts that we'd normally allow but that are obviously, unquestioningly super low quality like blogspam copy-pasted onto a site with a bazillion ads. It has to be pretty bad before we remove it and even then sometimes these are the first post to get traction about a news event so we leave them up if they're the best discussion going on about the news event. There's a lot of grey area here with CVE announcements in particular: there are a lot of spammy security \"blogs\" that syndicate stories like this.\n* ‚ö†Ô∏è Posts that are duplicates of other posts or the same news event. We leave up either the first one or the healthiest discussion.\n* ‚ö†Ô∏è Posts where the title editorialises too heavily or especially is a lie or conspiracy theory.\n* Comments are only very loosely moderated and it's mostly üö´ Bots of any kind (Beep boop you misspelled misspelled!) and üö´ Incivility (You idiot, everybody knows that my favourite toy is better than your favourite toy.) However the number of obvious GPT comment bots is rising and will quickly become untenable for the number of active moderators we have.\n\nThere are some topics such as Code of Conduct arguments within projects that I don't know where to place where we've been doing a civility check on the comments thread and using that to make the decision. Similarly some straddle the line (a link to a StackOverflow post asking for help and the reddit OP is the StackOverflow OP, but there's a lot of technical content and the reddit discussion is healthy). And even most üö´s above are left up if there's a healthy discussion going already by the time we see it.\n\n# So what now?\n\nWe need to decide **what r/programming should be about** and we need to write those rules down so that mods can consistently apply them. The rules as written are pretty vague and the way we're moderating in practise is only loosely connected to them. We're looking for feedback on what kind of place r/programming should be so tell us below.\n\n**We need additional mods**. If you're interested in helping moderate **please post below, saying why you'd be a good mod and what you'd would change about the space if you were**. You don't need to be a moderator elsewhere but please do mention it if you are and what we could learn on r/programming that you already know. Currently I think I'm the only one going down the new page every morning and removing the rule-breaking posts. (Today these are mostly \"how do I program computer\" or \"can somebody help me fix my printer\", and obvious spam.) This results in a lot of threads complaining about the moderation quality and, well, it's not wrong. I'm not rigorously watching the mod queue and I'm not trawling comments threads looking for bad actors unless I'm in that thread anyway and I don't use reddit every single day. So if we want it to be better we'll need more human power.\n\n# FAQ: Why do we need moderation at all? Can't the votes just do it?\n\nWe know there is demand for unmoderated spaces in the world, but r/programming isn't that space. This is our theory on why keeping the subreddit on topic is important:\n\n* Forums have the interesting property that **whatever is on the front page today is what will be on the front page tomorrow**. When a user comes to the site and sees a set of content, they believe that that's what this website is about. If they like it they'll stay and contribute that kind of content and if they don't like it they won't stay, leaving only the people that liked the content they saw yesterday. So the seed content is important and keeping things on topic is important. If you like r/programming then you need moderation to keep it the way that you like it (or make it be the place you wish it were) because otherwise entropic drift will make it be a different place. And once you have moderation it's going to have a subjective component, that's just the nature of it.\n* Because of the way reddit works, on a light news day r/programming doesn't get enough daily content for articles to meaningfully compete with each other. Towards the end of the day if I post something to r/programming it will immediately go to the front page of all r/programming subscribers. So while it's true that sub-par and rule-breaking posts already do most of their damage before the mods even see them, the whole theory of posts competing via votes alone doesn't really work in a lower-volume subreddit.\n* Because of the mechanics of moderation it's not really possible to allow the subreddit to be say 5% support questions. Even if we wanted to allow it to be a small amount of the conten, the individuals whose content was removed would experience and perceive this as a punitive action against them. That means that any category we allow could theoretically completely take over r/programming (like the career posts from last week) so we should only allow types of content that we'd be okay with taking it over.\n\nPersonally my dream is for r/programming to be the place with the highest quality programming content, where I can go to read something interesting and learn something new every day. That dream is at odds with allowing every piece of blogspam and \"10 ways to convince your boss to give you a raise, #2 will get you fired!\"",

        "selfText": "# Welcome to r/Fitness - Reddit's #1 Health and Fitness community!\n\nr/Fitness is a **self-help** community.  Before asking questions, you are expected to have made a good faith effort to find an answer on your own and show it by explaining where you looked, what you found, and why it wasn't enough.  We ask you to respect that the people answering your questions are volunteering their time, knowledge, and experience.\n\nTo help answer your questions, get you started, or help you continue on your fitness journey, we have complied a comprehensive Wiki and FAQ.  [**https://thefitness.wiki/**](https://thefitness.wiki/) is the result of community discussions on best practice, expert opinion, emerging science, and general know-how from those who have made fitness their lifestyle or profession.\n\n# The r/Fitness wiki is moderator funded, and this year we are asking for your help to make it community funded.\n\nDomain registration and hosting costs over $500 per year, but it is important to us to house this resource off-platform.  Why?  To keep it ad-free and prevent any undue sponsorship or marketing influence, to keep it organized, to ensure content and links to outside resources work regardless of app or browser, to enable proper search functionality, and to make sure it's available during site outages.  **If you'd like to contribute**, you can anonymously donate any amount via [an Amazon e-gift card](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-1_US_Email-eGift-Card/dp/B004LLIKVU) to [purplespengler@gmail.com](mailto:purplespengler@gmail.com).  Donations will be closed once the hosting fees are reached, and we thank you for your consideration.\n\n# Resources - Check these for answers before posting a question!\n\n* [The r/Fitness Wiki and FAQ.](https://thefitness.wiki/)  Most questions that people come to r/Fitness with can be answered directly by the Wiki and FAQ or by applying the information found in it.  It will always be the best first place to look for answers.  Moderators or the community can help direct you to the right information if you have trouble finding it.\n* [Searching past threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/search?q=&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)  r/Fitness has over a decade of discussion threads that are very likely to have answers to your questions if our Wiki and FAQ does not.  Remember when searching that fitness and exercise are not fast moving topics, and even discussions that are several years old are going to be relevant today.\n* [Google.](https://www.google.com/)  Yes, really, or your preferred search engine.  Google excels at being a source of answers for common fitness and exercise questions including exercise alternatives or progressions, meal plan and food options, equipment or product reviews, and so on.\n* Yourself.  Many questions we see come down to a matter of personal preference or can be answered by \"it depends.\"  You should check in with yourself before asking the community to decide something for you.\n\n# The Rules\n\n[The rules for r/Fitness can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules)\n\nr/Fitness is a high traffic community that is heavily moderated to maintain quality control and make good use of the resources provided.  When making a post or comment, you are expected to understand and abide by our rules.  Make sure to review [Rule #0 - No Threads That Are Answered by the Wiki, Searching Threads, or Google](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules/rule0) and [Rule #5 - No Questions Related to Injury, Pain, or Any Medical Topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules/rule5) as these are the two most commonly broken rules by new users.\n\n# Weekly Threads\n\nr/Fitness has some regularly posted, themed threads that you can see the schedule for below.

        "selfText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy background: I'm working as an apprentice mainly using JavaScript (front-/backend and some html/css) for almost a year now. Before that I did a java course to try out if programming was my thing, got to basic algorithms like sorts, game of life, creating a bingo sheet with user input. I also have a basic understanding of SQL and NoSQL.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a while now I have been feeling the desire to pick up another language. It should be type safe and have the potential to pick some deeper concepts and understanding of programming languages in general on the go, so i get to know more behind the scenes stuff (which i don't feel so much in JavaScript than maybe with Java) also in order to make picking up other languages in the future easier, if required.\n\nIt should also be a potentially strong backend language.\n\nAlthough i'm not planning on changing my job anytime soon, it should also be in strong demand on the market. It's just nice to know what you're doing is not just for fun/understanding but also increases my value for potential employers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConsidering all of this, there seem to be two languages left: Java and C# (C# is surprisingly popular in my area, also the tech stack for C# jobs tends to not involve as many other technologies as java).\n\nI'm feeling pretty ready to dive into C# but theres still this question that's bugging my mind:As it's a hobby for now: Where does C# shine? Where can i gain motivation and fun by thinking \"this will come in so handy when building xy\"? (Similar to quick and simple in python, fast in C++, universal/scalable in java, frontend/web in javascript and so on)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance for your replies and input.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. of course i tried googling but i failed finding a common consensus on this as clear as for other languages\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Not into game dev as of now",

Students from those colleges pay exam fees and sit for NCC EDU diploma tests.\n\nI am a student at one of those colleges. I am studying Level 4 Diploma in Computing.\n\nThis Diploma did not start with a couse in programming. Practically every CS Year 1 starts with a programming course.\n\nThe Computer Systems class seems to be a watered-down version of Comptia A+. There is not even a bit of system programming in that course. And the coursework I have to do has a very far-fetched task. I am supposed to write a report to a CEO about updating IT infrastructure of the entire company. It looks very much like bullshit (sorry if I am impolite) consulting task. Moreover, other tasks don't go deep into computer system theory (the curticulum itself has shallow computer system theory and practice).\n\nComputer Network class also does not have any programming tasks. NCC does not teach typical system programming languages like C. It is as shallow as Computer System class. The class has little to no practical lab tasks.\n\nSkills for Computing class also has far-fetched tasks but its teaching materials and curriculum provided by NCC is too lightweight. It does not explain theories behind the formulae very well. The presentation slides provided by NCC gives formulae and example problems for using those formulae. Other parts of SfC are about so-called problem solving. But instead of teaching about real problem solving useful for future programmers , NCC teaches us how to do consulting (not always about IT) tasks for business owners. Wishy-washy corporate speak is the worst of all. There are several project management acronyms but no deep discussions about project management.\n\nThe next class is Database class and I haven't learnt programming. This class also focuses on consultant tasks that are too far-fetched. I am supposed to design an entire database system for a business and the course material doesn't get deep into a database system like MySQL or PostgreSQL or database theory. I must remind you that this class lasted only a month (four days a week). \n\nThe worst thing about the NCC programme is teaching algorithms before teaching programming. I am now taking algorithms class even though I haven't taken a class in programming. It is unbelieveable.\n\nNCC provides presentation slides as course materials. They can't go really deep into theory and practice. The teacher who taught computer system and computer networking class has little programming experience and a former network engineer in industry for only a few years. He doesn't seem to understand the course materials. Maybe it is because of his English. Maybe he doesn't understand the technical content. I don't know.\n\nThe entire programme from Level 4 to 6 (level 6 is a top-up degree at affiliated UK university) does not has compiler course, data structure class, system programming, usability and ui/ux, operating systems, data science and machine learning courses.\n\nIt seems like I will have to learn everything I need to know about Computer Science and Software Engineering on my own.",

We use Jira and do sprints, tickets, etc, but I have to ask my boss and my project manager several times to get me a damn deadline.\n\nWhy? Because last summer I was working on a project that they gave no deadline for other than \"soon\"- so I thought \"soon\" meant several weeks, not a few days. They were upset about it not getting done and I made it clear that, sorry, but you did not give me a date on when this needed to be done. So I balanced it with the other things I have as responsibilities (on call stuff, analytics, etc).\n\nNow I am insistent that with any project I get, they give me a deadline. Our PM just got promoted and while I love them as a person, I can't help but feel peeved when they hardly plan out future sprints on Jira (or use Jira correctly in general) give project timelines prior to assigning project tickets, etc.\n\nI like my company and team, I just think we could do better project planning wise. The sr devs on my team get stuff done relatively quick so I am not sure if it bothers them as much. I am not a strong dev (working on it) so timelines help me pace my work out better when I balance other projects I am assigned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "selfText": "Eyyyy long time no whatever. A few months ago, I saw my local rec department was putting on a casual meet in November, so I signed up! My last meet was in 2017, and I have definitely not been consistently training hard in the last 6 years. It's been intermittent at best. Since this was unsanctioned, they did everything in pounds. Singlets were not required, but typical USAPL rules for other attire and lifts applied.\n\n[TLDR on Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzhBmCoA8VX/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) I went 8/9 and hit some nice PRs.\n\n**Training**\n\nEarlier in the year, I used the Stronger By Science program builder to make a program that accomplished the same general principle as Jeff Nippard's minimalism programming while doing just a bit more total volume and focusing a little harder on the big lifts (RDL instead of DL, because that's what I like if I'm not training for a comp). I used this template probably 4 months.\n\nAround 3 months out, I signed up for Stronger By Science online coaching, and I feel like that went quite well. My coach's feedback each week was great. Training was 5 days per week, and sessions typically took between 1 hour and 1.5 hours. I won't go into too much detail, but it was high frequency and high volume. It obviously worked well for me, but there were times where it was difficult to keep the schedule going between work and other commitments. I feel like this training commitment isn't one I can be on perpetually, but every now and then is manageable.\n\nI really was feeling beat up from like 5 weeks ago all the way up to 2 weeks ago. Squat was usually feeling good, but bench and deadlift were total crap shoots. The reps/RPEs I was hitting said my deadlift max should be \\~522 lb, but I failed 510 as attempted training weights multiple weeks in a row. My previous best was 505.\n\nA *fun* thing I had to deal with during this training was dislocating my shoulder twice, with the most recent occurrence last Saturday.\n\n**Diet**\n\nI use MacroFactor, so I just tracked everything on that. I was planning on competing in the 90 kg (198.4 lb) weight class, but they didn't have enough participants to have separate classes. They used Wilks to determine winners, separated by gender. I typically just kept protein between 150 and 200 grams and planned to just slowly add mass from my 194 lb starting weight to fill out the weight class. I  did a short sodium and water load starting Wednesday (I probably could have started earlier, but I didn't care that much, honestly), tried (mostly unsuccessfully) to cut sodium Thursday and Friday while also drinking \\~10 liters of water per day. I cut water intake around 5 PM Friday. I was consistently weighing 199-201 lb on my bathroom scale the last week. I weighed 197 lb on that scale the morning of the competition. I then weighed in at 194.2 lb an hour later at check in. I'm not sure where the 3 lb difference came from (maybe my scale is hot garbage?), but hey I'll take it.\n\nAfter weighing in, I at like 300 calories of Skittles and drank like 2 liters of water mixed with Propel powder and a Red Bull. I also took some Excedrin because why not. After about 40 minutes, I ate a banana. I really felt like I did a nice job getting some quick carbs in for energy then going for something a little more filling so I wouldn't be hungry. I gradually ate the remaining 400 calories of Skittles in my bag throughout the morning. I was starting to feel actively hungry after squats, so I just ate a piece of wheat bread. I also drank another Red Bull after squats and after bench.\n\nI will note that I eat a minimally-processed diet outside of protein powder and bars. The vast majority of my food is something I cook from scratch and fruits/vegetables. I also try to keep my saturated fat intake down. All that to say I believe the whole-foods-based diet contributed positively to my overall training experience and satiety.\n\nI'm not going to make a whole section for this: Sleep hygiene is not to be underestimated. I'm typically asleep by 10:00 PM and wake up naturally (no alarm) around 7:00 AM.\n\n**Squat**\n\nEverything was feeling good during warmups. I recall in 2017 having trouble warming up and getting in the groove. I blamed this on lifting during the evenings. I now lift around 11:00 AM, and I think that made a huge difference today.\n\n* 1st attempt: 375 lb. I hit this earlier this week, and it felt pretty easy, maybe RPE 7.5. This was just a super safe attempt to get on the board. My previous PR was 390. It went up fast.\n* 2nd attempt: 395 lb. This was a PR for me. I originally signed up for 390, but 375 felt almost like a warmup, so I added a bit. This also went up fast.\n* 3rd attempt: 405 lb. I contemplated going for more here, but I wanted that 4 plate PR so badly and didn't want to bite off too much and still not be there. I took the safe route. From the video, I obviously had more room there; I hardly slowed down at the sticking point at all. I'm satisfied going away with a 15 lb PR and big milestone, though.\n\n**Bench**\n\nBench has always been more worst lift. I have long arms and a history of shoulder problems. In training, I hit 265 lb on paused bench, which felt like RPE 9. I was feeling good during training one day and went for 275, but it just wouldn't budge. I then had trouble with 265 and ended up at 255 for my training weight. Bench is just so hit or miss for me. Warmups felt nice, though.\n\n* 1st attempt: 255 lb. Felt way easier than it had a couple weeks ago. Flew up.\n* 2nd attempt: 270 lb. Also felt easy. This is what I am showing in the Instagram post. Hardly felt the sticking point at all. Based on how my first attempt felt, I had considered increasing this to 275, which I kind of wish I had. My all time bench PR is 275, but my paused bench PR was 265 before this, so I'll call it a 5 lb PR.\n* 3rd attempt: 280 lb - no lift. I was SO close to hitting this. At the sticking point, my left hand just crept down like an inch. I didn't even realize it and bitched at the spotter for grabbing the bar. I then apologized after watching the video... I felt like I could have hit it if we had a 4th attempt.\n\n**Deadlift**\n\nI was still warming up when they started the first lifter. We had only 8 competitors, so that meant I was only a couple minutes away. I quickly wrapped up my warmups, which were also feeling pretty good. My leverages have just always made me better at deadlifting than anything else. This was the only lift of the day where I was scheduled to go last instead of second to last. They guy before me started at 475 lb.\n\n* 1st attempt: 485 lb. I actually thought I had told them 480 lb. When they put a 5 on each side instead of a 2.5, I asked them about it, thinking they got their plate math wrong. They then said, \"You wanted 485, right?\" I told them I thought I said 480. They offered to change it down, but since they'd already loaded the bar and were ready for me, I just said, \"Nah this is fine.\" We all got a good laugh from that. It went up super fast and felt easy.\n* 2nd attempt: 505 lb. I was planning on playing it safe with a 500 lb second attempt. 505 was my previous PR, and I'd been failing 510 in training leading up to this. I was afraid deadlifting just wasn't going to go well. But 485 felt so good, and the guy pulling before me did 505, so I just told them to leave the 5 extra pounds on and went for it. Went up fast and smooth, no issues at all.\n* 3rd attempt: 530 lb. I was, again, planning on going for 515 here. I just had no clue how this was going to go based on how training had been. Well, the guy pulling before me pulled 525. He was like 50 lb ahead of me on squat and bench, but I thought I could at least go for the deadlift win. I told them to add 5 lb (they were running out of room on the bar; they'll need to get some real plates if they keep doing this) and it went up quickly. I feel like I had more in the tank here, but hey, I'll take the 25 lb PR and deadlift win.\n\n**Thoughts**\n\nThey hope to make it a sanctioned event in the future. I came in second overall. The guy who came in first had a 399.4 Wilks, so I'm fine with \"losing\" to someone so ahead of me. It was tons of fun going head to head on deadlifts, though.\n\nEveryone was incredibly friendly and supportive. This was such an enjoyable meet, and I'm proud that I've made some nice progress. I'll need to dial things down a bit for the next few months, but I'll probably sign up again next year. ",

        "selfText": "This meet was 20 minutes from my house, I know the director runs smooth meets, and it was about a year after my last meet. No brainer. The meet also happened today so I‚Äôm a little scattered but wanted to get this down. I initially did meet reports because I was kind of lonely in the powerlifting world, but now I have a really great IRL crew including my awesome friends who came out to watch and handle me, so I post these to mark how far I‚Äôve come since my first meet. \n\n*My prep*\n\nThis was a fucking killer prep. We tried a new structure and it worked really well. Another thing I want to note is that I am embarking on a 2-3 year bulk/cut cycle with the long term goal of being a much more jacked 82.5 lifter. However, I did not want to pause the bulk I was currently on to lift in that class for this event, so I lifted in the 90 kg class. I think it also helped my prep that I was actively bulking through it. The only issue with my prep was a tendency to flirt with high squats. However, for this meet I really, really wanted a 400 kg total. I didn‚Äôt need a big squat to get that but going 3/3 would take a lot of pressure off of me so I made a conservative squat plan with the intention of sinking each one. I knew if I could go 3/3 I would have a shot to secure the total on my second deadlift, and then I could wild out on the last deadlift to get a little silly. Bench and deads, no notes, PR‚Äôd in prep and everything moved wonderfully. \n\nVideo of all lifts can be found [here](https://youtu.be/kP_NrWGby7A)\n\nSQUAT: \n\n1: 137.5 yes good. Easy. Whatever \n\n2: 145 also yes\n\n3: 150 hell yes!! A lifetime PR and 5 kg meet PR. Moved easy. Exactly what I wanted‚Äîenough room in the tank that I wasn‚Äôt worn out for bench and deads and heavy enough to take some pressure off the other events for the total I wanted \n\nBENCH: \n\n1: 75 this was my third attempt at my last meet\n\n2: 80, little wobble. I had planned anyway to jump to 82.5 and technically I had no choice but if there had been a more conservative option I would have taken it \n\n3: 82.5, miss. Lol. I have hit this in the gym before, and still walked away with another 5 kg meet PR. \n\nMy back was really sore at this point but my amazing and excellent handler found me a foam roller so I foam rolled and ate a sausage egg muffin sandwich and deadlift warmups were ON FIRE! Missing the third bench meant I would need to use my third deadlift attempt to secure the total, but making all my squats like the genius that I am meant I wouldn‚Äôt need to ask too much of myself to get it. \n\nDEADLIFT:\n\n1: 157.5 I am visibly pissed off here that the platform crew didn‚Äôt straighten out the bar for me and I had to kneel down and roll it into place with my precious minute. But it was fine for the rest of the attempts \n\n2: 167.5 yes good, 2.5 kg meet PR. At this point, the total was 397.5. My coach came to me and said he thought I could definitely do 172.5, maybe even 175. And I was like yeah and I know this is basically taking the same weight twice, and it‚Äôs anticlimactic, but...\n\n3: 170 yeah I just did this to grab that total. I‚Äôll wild out at the next meet. My best gym deadlift is 175 and that was definitely available on the day. Maybe next time. \n\n*What I did right* \n\nI was really diligent about recovery during this prep and I was actively eating in a surplus and that probably did most of the work for me, I do not care. I was told I had the biggest women‚Äôs total at the meet, I will confirm that when the results are posted. I also got drug tested. I think that speaks more to how fractured the powerlifting world is across feds than to whether or not I am strong. \n\nI was also an execution machine. Historically I have been high on hype, but for this meet I just put my headphones in between attempts and chilled out. Focusing on a total instead of individual lifts also helped me think about lifting strategically instead of desperately trying to PR everything, even though I did that too. This was a major mental PR. Also I have not gone 3/3 on squats since 2018. I am extremely grateful for my friends who came out to watch my meet even though it was just me lifting, and for my friend that stepped up to handle me when I asked for help. I like my powerlifting crew a lot. \n\n*What I wish I did differently*\n\nI wish I‚Äôd fueled a little better between squats and bench because I think my back was tired and shaky, but the deadlifts moved so well after eating that I see it was a fuel problem. Then I could have gone all out on my third deadlift. That is a very minor thing though.\n\n*What‚Äôs next*\n\nNothing! Whatever the next meet on my timeline is, that is what I will do. My next goal is to total 410, and force my squats to be consistent enough that I can actually talk about big numbers when planning attempts instead making a plan for how to not bomb out.",

It is worth noting that my performance at the final 1+ set of that week was better than my performance of Week 10, which leaves me with a lot to be desired...\n\nBefore starting The Rippler I was on holidays for 3 weeks and I was doing 531 SSL just to maintain strength and before that I did Candito's 6 week program which gave me good results.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy program was as follows:\n\nMonday: T1 Squat, T2 Squat, T3a Single-leg weighted hyperextensions, T3b Leg curls/Leg extensions, T3c Calves work\n\nTuesday: T1 Bench press, T2a Bench press, T2b Incline DB press/Chins, T3a DB curls/DB French press, T3b Ab work\n\nThursday: T1 Deadlift, T2a Deadlift, T2b Reverse BB lunges, T3a GHR/Leg extensions, T3b Calves work\n\nFriday:  T1 CGBP, T2a CGBP, T2b Incline DB press/Chins, T3a DB hammers/Overhead cable tricep extensions, T3b Ab work\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring previous programs that I've followed I didn't use OHP neither and exchanged it for CGBP, reason is that I'm still working on my overhead mobility.\n\nCody says that T2 should be variations of T1, or use the same movement if technique needs to be honed in. I consider myself an early intermediate lifter, so I decided to make T2 the same as T1 in order to improve my technique. Next time I'll be running The Rippler again, I'll probably use the variation method and see where it gets me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile running The Rippler I could feel that weights in high intensities were feeling considerably lighter than before, and on +sets I was always hitting PRs. Another important point to note is that during these 10 weeks I did not experience any joint pain, while usually I'm quite prone to left quadricep tendon inflammations.\n\nI loved the program and I loved the higher intensity work it put me through, I enjoyed the undulating progression, I would surely follow it again. Cody has done an amazing job at providing the community all these years with such valuable, high quality information.\n\nAs I said earlier, I'll never know what my real RM would be during the 12th Week but that's okay. I'll use Week's 10 numbers which better depict my current fatigued state in order to continue with another percentage-based program or something like GZCL General Gainz which is RPE based and will suit my current life better, or something with even less volume like a minimum effective training dose approach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "user": "nespinola24",
        "score": 39,
        "selfText": "Overview\n\nLast weekend, 11/4/23, I (24 year old male) competed at the North State Barbell Open in Chico, CA. I totaled 520/1146 at a body weight of 80.4/177.3. My best lifts were: squat-170/374.8, bench-130/286.6, deadlift-220-485. This was my first meet since last September, my first WRPF meet, and by far my the best meet I‚Äôve ever had as far as performance goes. The credit for the performance goes to my coach, Dr. Dave Osborn who get me set up perfectly to perform well at the meet and my wife who coached me on meet day and did a spectacular job. \n\nTraining\n\nI‚Äôve been working with Dr. Dave Osborn now since November of 2021 and have been making strides since then. This spring, due to a busy schedule in my personal life, we switched from training 4 days a week to 3. With the 3 day training set up, I train two SBD days split up by an accessory day. On day 1, I train main squat and bench as well as conventional deadlift as a secondary deadlift movement. Day 2 is only accessory movements. Then, day 3 is main deadlift followed by a secondary bench, then hibar squat. Early on, the secondary bench was pause Larsen press, but later transitioned to pause close grip bench. \n\nThis training set up has proven to be my favorite way to train by far. I‚Äôve found training two SBD days a week to be so much fun, but also great for my strength, conditioning for meet day, as well as practicing my execution of heavy competition lifts. \n\nThis summer is when I was able to dial in my training and recovery. I have summers off of work so planning a late fall meet gave me the opportunity to train hard over the summer and realize that work at the end of the fall. Just about every week I was setting new rep PRs all summer which gave me a huge confidence boost. \n\n6 weeks out, I took singles at RPE 9 and walked away with a 10 lb PR each for squat, bench, and deadlift at 370/285/485. 5 weeks out was a deload week, followed by a reload singles week 4 weeks out at 315/245/415. Then, 3 weeks out I took singles that were intended to be above a 2nd attempt, but below a 3rd. That week I went 360/275/465. 2 weeks out I took opener singles at 335/255/435. The week of the meet I took singles at 60% with some low intensity accessories. \n\nWeigh Ins\n\nSince WRPF has day before weigh ins, I traveled to Chico on Thursday, 11/2 after work. Then Friday morning I went to weigh in. There were no surprises at weigh ins. I came in at 80.4 which was on the lighter side of what I‚Äôve been weighing for the past few weeks. \n\nAfter weigh ins, I made sure that I got around and moved throughout the day so that when it came time to going to bed I would feel like I had a full day and fall asleep easier. I have always had trouble sleeping the night before a meet. Usually it comes down to nerves, but this time I felt like I was going to sleep well. I truly wasn‚Äôt nervous about the meet at all, lots of confidence, but could not fall asleep for the life of me. I woke up feeling energized so I decided not to check my sleep data from my watch until after the meet so I wouldn‚Äôt get in my head about how it could affect my performance. I ended up getting 5.25 hours of sleep which I probably would‚Äôve overthought and let bother me if I knew it. \n\nMeet Day\n\nSquat\n\nSquats were being done with a squat bar and monolift so I made sure to warmup on the only mono and squat bar in the warmup area, even though I walked my squats out. Warmups felt exactly as I planned. All my squats moved as normally and I felt great going into my opener. \n\nI opened at 152.5/336.1 and hit it comfortably. My wife wanted to call a 12.5 kg jump to 165 and I knew that would be a great jump. For my 2nd attempt at 165/363.8, without thinking, I sunk the squat deeper than I needed to and coming out of the hole I moved slower than I would have liked. I had good acceleration into lockout afterward but the slower squat made my wife call a more conservative jump for the 3rd attempt. I took 170/374.8 for my 3rd squat, got the depth figured out and hit it better than my 2nd attempt. All in all I was happy that I had gone 3/3 with a small PR on squat and was well on my way to building a great total.  \n\nBench \n\nAll the SBD training during meet prep had me ready to roll right into bench without any problem. My energy levels felt great and it showed during warmups. Everything had great speed and I was able to go into bench with a lot of confidence. \n\nI took 115/253.5 as a speedy opener. I‚Äôve made the mistake of making too big of jumps before so my wife kept me at 7.5 kg jumps. My 2nd bench at 122.5/270.1 moved very comfortably and exactly how I needed it to move to take my goal 3rd attempt of 130/286.6. I felt great going into my 3rd and took it to my chest well but pressing off was a challenge. I came off with good speed, but my right tricep slowed down a bit which worried me that I might have had downward movement, but I locked out and got three whites for a good lift and a small bench PR and a 600kg subtotal. \n\nDeadlift \n\nBench had brought a bit of fatigue and tightness to my upper back and I wasn‚Äôt sure how that would play out for deadlift. Warmups for deadlift were chaotic. There were only two deadlift platforms and most the lifters in my flight, including myself, wanted to use the Texas DL bar to warmup but got a late start due to a lifter in the flight ahead of us still needing to take their last warmup. I finished my warmup earlier than I had planned to give the rest of the lifters time to get theirs in since I was one of the lightest pullers in the flight. \n\nI opened at 197.5/435.4 and hit it with speed. The bar on the platform was a Kabuki DL bar, but it didn‚Äôt affect my pulls negatively. We jumped to 210/463 for an aggressive 2nd attempt and I hit it with enough room in the tank to take my maximum allotted 3rd of 220/485 and finish it out better than I did in training. It was a great way to cap off a 9/9 day and a great meet. \n\nTLDR: I went 9/9 totaling 520kg (a 47.5 kg meet PR) at 80.4 kg for the best meet I‚Äôve ever had. \n\nHere‚Äôs a link to all the lifts from the day- https://photos.app.goo.gl/EMBQtqqQCcdrNNCY9 \n\nHere‚Äôs a link to my Instagram recap with only my 3rd attempts- https://www.instagram.com/p/CzP1ecVrIcR7MgKMXxQ5hrAwXjWetlhQz-BiE00/?igshid=MTljbWpuNmh3YjVr",
