I gave him a clear high level overview of what I was optimizing for (which I had intended to in case I was asked to elaborate) without going into the implementation. Rejected.\r  \n\r  \nEmailed him with a thanks, and asked for feedbacks on how I could have done better. He told me I did well for the interview, aced his coding challenges (I almost instantly solved them) along with all his other technical questions. But in the end, I was rejected for not being able to go in-depth into what I was doing in my current work while masking it as \"trade secret\", which he states he \"will not take for an answer\". Wtf? I literally signed an NDA? I told him that the method I had implemented was unconventional and according to my bosses, rarely used by competitor firms. He literally, I'm not joking, replied with a \"Yes, indeed, if you revealed too much it would be a red flag on your integrity as well\".\r  \n\r  \nThere is no winning in this.

I always assumed this was because web presented a relatively lower bar to entry skillwise, but I wonder if it's because there are more roles to fill.  I assumed I didn't hear more about low level work because it was more technically demanding, therefore less appealing to people, but I worry, maybe there's just no real demand for that type of work.\n\nConceptually I have no desire to be a front end dev (like everyone else seems to want to). What I find a lot more compelling is, what I see to be, the path less traveled.  I've begun to study what goes into creating operating systems and low level stuff like that.  Even though the material is a bit advanced for me I've started to chip away at it because I find it more interesting, but am I doing this just for my own academic curiosity? In terms of a career shift, would I be better off, maybe, studying backend development, and then returning to os dev at a later date for fun?  \n\nLet's say I decide to go for a backend job or something like that instead, would having a (albeit probably shitty) os in my portfolio help me stand out, or would it ultimately have been a waste of time if my goal was backend developer?  Would that impress a recruiter, or would he just go, \"meh, that's neat, but irrelevant, you should have studied more django.\" \n\nHope that was clear, and not too long, thank you for reading!",

He has played around with scratch quite a lot because of school. While yes it is a visual programming language and it gets a lot of slack because of that, it does not mean he doesn’t understand the fundamental concepts. He knows about types, variable, control flow, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, etc. Even if they were in visual form, he still understands the concepts behind them. That and he has watched some videos explaining paradigms and the programming concepts. What he wants is to learn and actually use his first programming language and do it in a way where he also learns how to program in an industry standard way or at least a way that doesn’t scream “I have no idea what I’m doing”. I understand this is mostly learned from experience and reading articles, but I thought it may help if his first language didn’t do too much magic wand waving behind the scenes for him. \n\n\n\nI am currently helping a friend learn programming. He already started with the Scratch route from his school class and now wants to delve into proper programming and asked me what language he should learn first that would make him also learn good programming practices. I’ve been thinking about it for a bit, and while a bit difficult for him, I honestly think Rust is really good for learning good programming practices but I’m not entirely sure as I ain’t an expert. Would anyone else be able to give their input?

If you sign up for this Udemy course, you'll get the updated content automatically once I finish it. It won't be a separate course.\n* It's totally fine to start on the first edition and then read the second edition later.

If so, please explain! I would think that the body is smart enough to do the movement in the most effective way, right? If I remember correctly, the most powerful hip extensor when the knee is flexed is the adductor magnus, so it would make sense that activiating it leads to knee valgus but also to a stronger squat. \n\nOn a side note, I agree that a squat without caving is more aesthetically pleasing.

I've made pretty good progress all while losing body fat. My progress has stopped and I wanted to look into other options. The group training seems interesting since it's cheaper than normal 1 on 1 while still allowing you to interact with a coach albeit in a more limited capacity. I figured it might be a good middle ground. Have you used a simialr  service how has your exp been ?",

          "selftext": "**Background**:    \n\nI’m a 39-year-old male @ 5’9” and 173.0#\n\nI’ve been lifting off and on, for the past 23+ years, and I was really BIG on muscle confusion… I think I read too many damn magazines about short tricks to get six pack abs and beach ready arms. \n\nINCONSISTENT DIET LETTUCE BOY FTW. \n\nBut I did have a six pack years ago, and at some point along the way I set a lot of PR’s that I’ve since had the opportunity to smash (except for one bench rep PR set back in Jan. 2014). Anyway, I was never really consistent, until March of 2020 (thanks Covid). I started back-up with some bodyweight work (thanks /u/govschwarzenegger) which left me wrecked for a few too many days. \n\nEventually made my way back to the garage w/ actual weights and did some Muscle &amp; Fitness dumbbell routines until the gyms opened back up and dove head first into 531 Forever’s SVR II. \n\nProgramming that I’ve run through the years includes, but isn’t limited to: The Waterbury Method, Starting Strength (because, of course), Starr’s 5x5, 25 for Strength, every. damn. thing from T-Nation and Men’s Health… those M&amp;F d-bell routines… fast-forward to 531’s SVR II, BBB 3 Month Challenge, BBB, Beefcake; SBS (formerly A2S); PPSA’s Squatober, Deadcember, Let’s Pregame, Pool Season I &amp; II, Benchamin Franklin, and Brickhouse. \n\n**What is Bomb the Fitness Industry, Bro?**    \nIt’s a Frankenstein’d 531 program, written by /u/TheMightyGullet, in which you incorporate the tenants of 531’s 5’s pro, Boring But Big, AND Boring But Strong. This program is great, if you’re a volume junkie. [Here’s the direct link to TMG’s post from a few years back](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/rudoce/program_review_531_bomb_the_fitness_industry). I’d recommend reading his write-up to understand the plan fully. [There’s only one other review of the program](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/117dhtx/531_btfi_review/), by /u/hjprice14.\n\nThe *leaders* and *anchors* were set-up, as follows:\n\n*Leader*:    \n- 531 &amp; Jokers\n- 50-100 reps, accessories \n- BBB @ 50-60-70%, variation lift\n\n*Anchor*:    \n- 531\n- BBS - 10x5 @ FSL + 2.5% on 5+, 10x4 @ FSL + 5% on 3+, and 10x3 @ FSL + 10% on 1+\n- 25-50 reps, accessories\n- BBB @ 50-60-70%, variation lift\n\n**Things I liked**:    \nI’d never done the 50+ accessory reps during the leader; they’re often, as you know, left for the anchor. TMG was right in-that you’re burnt out once you hit the anchor, and more often than not, I was also dropping the accessory work (especially towards the final week or so, if not sooner). This was a fun twist on the typical 531 accessory work. \n\n**Things I changed/Did differently**:    \nI messed up my right knee doing front squats, and as a result had a difficult time walking for several weeks, in late-April. So, I needed something that I could do a whole bunch of “bro” work for 4-6 days a week. I lift at home, early, so it’s not an issue to get out to the pole barn for me. I thought to myself, “bro’s don’t squat, so I guess I’m a ‘bro.” I pulled all squats from the program, and only added deadlifts after the first three week cycle. My goal here was to set two new pressing PR’s, in bench and strict/military press. Once I was able to start deadlift again, I just wanted to pull 315#, for a PR. \n\nI did no joker work, here. More often than not, I was trying to get in-and-out (are those burgers really that good?). Also, I wanted to hold back on the ego lifting, which has gotten the better of me, through the years. \n\nTo add some extra “fun” into the program, I also took a tenet from BBB’s 3 Month Challenge, in which you increase the % of the BBB supplemental work each week from 50&gt;60&gt;70. I am not a smart man. Would I do this again? Absolutely. \n\nI also added in my own thing, because TRAINING ADHD! I began doing “100 Days of Summer” to grow my arms (I blame you, Starting Strength from *checks calendar* 200… okay, that’s a decade-plus…). Each day, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, I did 100 reps of bi’s and tri’s. No write-up on that one, as I wasn’t consistent enough, and didn’t do proper documentation on it. I’ll try it again next summer. \n\nI’m also a big fan of the 351 set-up, versus the 531 set-up. It’s personal preference, and more than likely won’t impact/affect performance. \n\n*My general week looked like this*:    \nD1 \n- Deads 351 @ 5’s PRO\n- CG Bench BBB 5x10 @ 50/60/70%\n\nD2\n- Bench 351 @ 5’s PRO\n- Press BBS 10x5 @ FSL\n\nD3\n- Deads BBS \n- Seated Press BBB 5x10 @ 50/60/70\n\nD4\n- Press 351 @ 5’s PRO\n- Deficit Deads BBB 5x10 @ 50/60/70%\n\nD5\n- Bench BBS 10x5 @ FSL\n\n**What worked?**    \nPressing volume. Turn the speaker up to 11, and press. My shoulders, chest, and tri’s BLEW UP during this run, all without injury/issue. \n\nMy body responds well to volume. But… no sets went to 11. \n\nI ate at maintenance. I didn’t want to get above 170# until Labor Day weekend (which is the official start of bulk szn for me). Breakfast was more often than not 4-6 eggs, 2 slices of toast, large bowl of oatmeal w/ pb and jelly, and a banana/fruit. Lunch was dinner leftovers, and dinner was generally meat and carbs w/ some fat (I have an issue getting enough fat into my diet). Really, by the 4th of July I was holding steady over 170#. I ultimately went from 166# &gt; 173#.\n\n**What didn’t work?**    \nDoing 100 lats and abs every workout, on top of the 50+ accessory reps, and all the 531/BBB/BBS work. It just didn’t happen. \n\nThe other issue I ran into was conditioning. Not being able to walk also meant no running. Which also meant rowing was pretty tough. I’m not quite sure when my knee finally healed, but safe to say my only conditioning during this program was to lift weights faster. See, it’s not just a meme, it’s a whey of life. \n\n**Well, let’s see it!**    \nOkay, calm down you little minx. \n\n[Here’s my failed bench PR attempt @ 200#](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cv-AurztJkw/). As one member said, I probably had too many warm-up sets going into the top set. But, I’d just tied my 195# PR. 200# is there, just need to be smarter about the approach, next time.\n\n[Here’s my deadlift PR @ 335#](https://www.instagram.com/p/CwAvflqJzpK/). So long, 315#. \n\n[Here’s my press PR @ 145#](https://www.instagram.com/p/CwFcw48pzOf/). And yes, there are dogs in the video. \n\nYou’ve scrolled this far, so here’s a [vanity pic](https://www.instagram.com/p/Csvnyr7OA0s/) I’d taken when I started 100 Days of Summer. I don’t have a post-BTFIB pic. Sorry. \n\n*Weight* - 166 &gt; 173\n\n*All-time PR’s*\n\n**Bench** - 195 &gt; 195\n\n**Deadlift** - 310 &gt; 335\n\n**Press**- 135 &gt; 145\n\n**What’s next?**    \nCurrently running Squatober for the 3rd straight year. Then, I’ll run PPSA’s “Benchamin Franklin” w/ deads added (the program doesn’t include deadlifts), hence the name: Benchamin Franklin is Dead, or BFD. Then, it’s Deadcember, and FINALLY, I’ll run BTM in January.",

          "user": "MythicalStrength",
          "score": 91,
          "selftext": "Howdy redditors,\n\nI’ve competed in another strongman competition, this time my first time as a Lightweight Male in the 181lb class.  I’ll cut to the chase and say I came in dead last and zero’d more events than I’d ever done before.  I’ve dropped 35lbs since March, and I’m still adjusting to my new body in that regard, which helped make this one of the most challenging competitions of my life.  I’m pretty excited in that regard, and thought I’d share the experience.\n\nIf you want to read about the training/nutrition leading up to it, check [here](http://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/)\n\nAnd for video of the full comp, check [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM4rfc9xAD8)\n\n**PRE-COMP**\n\nI ate the same breakfast I’ve been having every training day: 150g of egg whites mixed with 150g of beef bone broth with 1.5 scoops of Metabolic Drive and some powdered electrolytes.  A wild departure from my days of eating…nothing, so I could make weight, followed by some sort of sugary/fast food blitz.  I drove an uneventful 2.25 hours to the site and weighed in at 173.0 while wearing full sweats, shoes, and my strongman compression gear underneath.  \n\nI set-up camp and actually dug into one of my meals before the first event: 4 hardboiled whole pasture raised organic eggs mashed into a paste with a serving of grassfed sour cream and 4oz (cooked) of ground venison, personally hunted and butchered by my wife’s Uncle.  Another departure from my glory days, which I’ll address next, but it was also weird being so hungry when I hadn’t done anything yet.  \n\n**GOALS**\n\nSince I knew I was super behind the 8-ball on this due to my bodyweight, this was going to be a different kind of comp for me: this was about personal growth.  My goals were to not eat any junk OR carbs and keep it as carnivore as possible.  Not because I felt like this was more noble, but more to simply see if I could, and how it would go.  The Metabolic Drive was the closest “exception” and I packed an emergency Finibar in case I found myself crashing, but otherwise it was just going to be that mashed egg/venison mixture, green tea and water.  \n\nI also was going to go limited caffeine: only the stuff in the green tea.  I have a 3 week streak without energy drinks of coffee going, and I wanna see how long I can keep it going.  Again: no particular reason, just to see if I could.  In the past, I’d be about 2-3 energy drinks deep by the end of the day.  Did I “need” that?\n\nThe third goal was to not re-tear whatever it was I tore in my right knee on week 2 of “Juggeryoke”.  The first event was where I was most worried about that, since I did it on the log, but I was going to keep my eye on it all competition.\n\nAnd final goal was to leave it all out there and have fun.  It’s the whole reason I signed up.\n\n**EVENT 1: 200lb Log Clean and Press Each Rep**\n\nI was excited about this event, since cleaning each rep is awesome and gasses competitors.  Then I got to actually handle the log we were going to use and realized this was going to be a “ WHO can get a rep” contest for the lightweights.  The log handles were STUPID far apart, like the Rogue 10”.  \n\nFirst guy got the clean but no rep.  Second guy got in 2 of the grandest reps of all time with a jerk and a JPS-esque “press the log off the head” technique. \n\nI got set, got my head right, grabbed the log, went to clean it, felt it feel like a jillion pounds, got stuck midway, somehow through sheer force of will get it all the way to my chest…and knew that there was absolutely no way I was going to press it.  I let it crash, thinking that, if I could do better on another clean and not be so exhausted, I might be able to set up for a stronger press.  Well, that didn’t happen, and I didn’t want to re-tear my left bicep on an errant log clean, so after a few more attempts, I hung it up.  The guy after me got a jillion reps and was the clear candidate for first that day.\n\n**EVENT 2: Max Trap Bar in 3 attempts**\n\nI had been doing a ROM progression cycle on trap bar with 405lbs, so I knew I was good for that.  We were allowed to pick the starting weight in the rules meeting, so I asked for 400, knowing we’d go 20lb jumps from there.\n\nThe guy who also zero’d the log ended up asking for us to start with 380, and he missed that, so I knew if I got 400 I at least had a win there.  400 was grindy, but made it.  We were apparently pulling on the Eleiko Oppen bar, which was cool since it had knurl marks on the center of the handle, which made strapping in easy.  I had an issue with strapping in too far forward or backward in training and having the bar tilt.\n\nNo other MLWs went for 400, the next time one jumped in was at 460, so I went for that to match too.  460 felt WAY too damn heavy, but I pulled it.  Since we were doing “Rising Bar”, I decided to pass on 480 to allow me some recovery time, and asked for 500.  I really liked Rising bar for the strategic element of it, and it made a last man standing event tolerable.  I actually felt 500 ever so slightly start to break off the floor, but not enough to be worth chasing after.  My knee was holding up strong so far, and this was keeping it in place.\n\n**EVENT 3: Sandbag and sled drag**\n\nThis and the 4th event are why I signed up: medleys in a competition.  I missed these so much.  Unlike previous comps, I did ZERO sandbag training to prep for this, which was for the best, because I usually end up tearing the hell out of my arms when I do that.  \n\nI used some strongman cheating and put the sandbag on top of my feet as part of my set-up.  This gives a little bit of daylight between the floor and the bag, which allows for handholds.  I also ditched my competition shirt at this point and decided I was going to go for the Mariusz Pudzianowski/Jon Andersen Award for “Most Jacked Person at the Competition”, because if  can’t be the strongest at least I can look pretty while I lose.  You can actually hear some folks making commentary about it during this event.\n\nThe sandbag pick actually went pretty well, and the carry moved about as fast as I would expect with so minimal training.  The sled drag caught me off guard: about the only clue it was going to be so awful was watching the other competitors attempting the sled and being caught off guard.  So I went for the initial pull, realized it was going to be heavy as hell, and just leaned into it and pulled like hell, knowing that, if I ever stopped, I’d be dead.  Just like a shark.\n\nI was surprised when I ran out of time.  I felt like I was moving at a good pace.  I had a slight technical error getting set up on the straps, and I lost a little bit of time on the bag, but ultimately I imagine I needed to move faster on the sled.\n\nBut I think this was the first time I had a sled in a comp where I didn’t fall backwards on my butt, so that’s a win.  This got me a last place finish.\n\n**EVENT 4: Duckwalk and powerstairs**\n\nEvent was supposed to be duck walk 25’, do 3 reps of power stairs, then duckwalk it back.\n\nLotta dudes were struggling with those stairs, and I figured out where: those WIDE 100lb plates pretty much give you no opportunity to hinge.  I’m only 5’9, so I’m already sawed off as it is, but now that I have to take a sumo stance I was totally hosed.  \n\nBut also, you might be able to tell in the video: I about blacked out on the initial pick, and was basically jump zombie-ing forward until I went night-night.  I managed to fall forward, have the stars clear, do a quick pick and repeat.  I fell into the platform, corrected myself, and struggled futilely to get it to the platform.  But I gave it some solid effort, and loading my frame down with 100lbs over bodyweight was awesome for making every muscle in my body pop, so I got a cool facebook photo.  This, once again, got me last place.\n\n**EVENT 5: Stone Medley**\n\nI won’t bother listing weights and heights here, because as you saw on the video, it was a big goose egg.  This is the only event I have a bitter taste in my mouth about.  You might be able to see it in the video, but I was literally GLUED to the stone.  I applied a moderate amount of tack to myself, but the stone ITSELF was COATED in tacky from previous competitors, to the point that it was stuck to the platform.  So it didn’t matter about being strong enough to pick up the stone: I had to be strong enough to BREAK the tacky off the stone first and THEN pick it up, and then, once I got it lapped, it wasn’t going anywhere else.  With how high the platform was, my plan was to try to shoulder it, but I could never even get the momentum necessary, because it was like trying to walk through mud: each movement was about getting unstuck and then stuck again.\n\nI realized at that point I’m a dinosaur in the sport: everyone else is using tacky shirts and stone sleeves and, in turn, has material that can help by pass the tacky issue, while I’m just applying sticky stuff to my body.  I the future, I think I’m just going to avoid tackying myself and just rely on what’s on the stone.  Zero’d here.\n\nI will say that I got another great strongman win here: as I was standing there, bare chested and covered in tacky, another dude who was going that route was standing next to me.  He was definitely more “strongman built”.  He looked at me, there was a pause, and then he “Dude..are you, like, bodybuilding?”\n\nI replied with “Nope: just not eating enough”.\n\nHe appreciated that.  Told me I was definitely the leanest dude there, and I said “Well at least I won that”. \n\n**LESSONS LEARNED**\n\nI knew coming in this light was going to be a challenge, and it delivered.  Doing no specific training for the comp also added to that.  But, that’s really the big thing: I grew up.  Strongman isn’t my life anymore: it’s a thing I do for fun.  And that’s absolutely what happened: I had a blast and I DIDN’T have to change my life for it.  I kept training the week of the comp, went for a 3 mile walk with my family after it was done (and after having an AMAZING dinner at our favorite BBQ place where I got the biggest, fattest pork ribs I’d ever seen in my life alongside some amazing sliced brisket) and just treated this like it was an events day.  I intend to keep it this way: if a comp looks fun, I’ll sign up and have a blast.  And I got to help out some folks along the way: the guy who took second in my weight class cramped up BAD, so I gave him some of the electrolytes I brought and it totally transformed him.  I also let him use some of the goo gone and paper towels I brought for tacky removal and got him sold of WD-40.  And I got to meet a few awesome folks off reddit as well.  A dude named John (went by u/ifrankthepug back in the day) introduced himself to me: “Dude, are you MythicalStrength?  I’ve been reading your articles for 6 years!”  That was really cool, and honestly was one of the highlights of the competition.\n\nGot to meet up with u/eric_twinge as well.  Was awesome getting to put a face to the name.\n\n**WHAT’S NEXT**\n\nWell, about that: I originally had a competition signed up for 14 Oct…but I just went looking for it and it’s gone: instead, having been moved to 4 Nov.  That’s a less viable date for me, and currently I’m the only person in the 181 weight class, so there’s very little incentive to go do it compared to just a hard events day at home.  I have a 5k signed up for 15 Oct, and then I go for a Disney Cruise on 16 Oct.  So now that I don’t have a competition looming, I’m probably going to do 2 more weeks of Juggeryoke with a few movement alterations leading up to the cruise and most likely do a mini-famine there so that I can absolutely eat my face off the whole time I’m cruising.  After that?  Chaos is the Plan.  But I’ll be at this weight class for the next competition, whenever that happens.",

          "user": "MythicalStrength",
          "score": 97,
          "selftext": "JUGGERYOKE REVIEW\n\n**INTRO AND BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT**\n\n* These tend to run stupidly long whenever I write them and I’m going to try to not let that happen, since I also am already in the middle of writing up my competition report (writing the pre-stuff before the comp and will detail the comp when it happens) wherein I ALREADY speak about this program…but already I’m writing too much.\n\n* But allow me to start with the conclusion: this program is awesome, like most of Jamie Lewis’ programs.  It looks daunting until you finally do it, and then you realize the genius built into it.  It has my approval, and I highly recommend people pick it up alongside the “Feast/Famine/Ferocity” bundle [here]( https://plagueofstrength.com/the-feast-famine-and-ferocity-diet-is-now-updated-and-available-as-an-e-book/).  \n\n**WHAT IS JUGGERYOKE**\n\n* Jamie sums it up as “the traptastic YuggerYoke Protocol V 3.0, a 3 page pdf of a super trap-heavy full-body training program that will appeal to strongmen, powerlifters, and anyone trying to look like a Marvel superhero.”  I assumed this was a 6 week program, since Jamie says in the document “After 6 weeks of this, you should be ready for the beach, looking like a lost member of the X-Men.”, but in the actual Juggeryoke link it says “This product is not a book- it’s a 3 page PDF specialization program designed to be used for 8 weeks to quickly bring up your yoke area (traps and shoulders).”  Whelp, I’m finishing the 6th week right now and writing my review but I DO intend to carry it forward for the next 2 weeks as I prep for a follow on comp on 14 Oct…so maybe I’ll write about that too.  Chaos is the plan.\n\n* Jamie has a 5-6 day and a 3-4 day variant of the program in the book, similar to what he did with “Feast, Famine and Ferocity”, which turned out to a positive for me while I ran it.\n\n**PROGRAM OVERVIEW**\n\n* I won’t give away the full programs, [although I DID take video of every single workout and you could most likely piece it together from that]( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfcuGAffLlSe6Uwn7B4yaY6zDq1cs3TfV), but still: please buy the program and support Jamie.  \n\n* I primarily ran the 5-6 day variant, which is effectively 3 full body workouts with an arm day in between each day for a total of 5 directed workouts and a 6th one wherein you can do whatever you want (similar to the “Dealer’s Choice” from Feast/Famine/Ferocity).  The 3-4 day variant takes those 2 arm workouts and merges them into the 3 full body days, along with a bit more exercise shuffling, and gives a bit more guidance on what to do on the 4th day as a gap filler.\n\n* The program requires training without a belt and a daily 1.5 mile walk, both of which are awesome.  It includes front squatting and squatting, push pressing and strict pressing, touch and go benching and pause benching, high pulls and HEAVY shrugs, ab wheel and hanging leg raises with lat shrugs, squat singles, triples and squatting for time.  That final bit was definitely my “favorite” part of the program.  1-2 sets of 2-3 minutes of squatting with 135lbs on your back.  I, of course, opted for 2 sets of 3 minutes and used 1 minute of rest between, and made it a goal to hit a new rep PR each week.  That was a fantastic challenge.\n\n**MY DEVIATIONS**\n\n* When I run a program the first time, I like to stick with it pretty close, BUT I also picked Juggeryoke in particular because it would allow me to include some movements that would benefit me for my upcoming competition.  So in that regard: I used a strongman log for my push pressing work, an axle for all my other pressing (bench, incline and strict), same axle for most of my skull crushers and reverse curls, grenade balls with chains for more of my arm work, and a trap bar for my high pulls and my shrugs.  Also, on the day where I was to do 15x1 squats, I often would lower the bar weight and use chains instead.  This was primarily due to sustaining a slight knee injury in the second week of the program during log clean and push press.  I moved a bit too quickly and possibly tore a meniscus.  By the end of the program it was feeling better, but it still seemed to work well to limit loading at the bottom of the rep and increase it toward the top.  Besides: Dan John said that, if he had to do it all over again, he’d always squat with chains, so good enough.\n\n* I took to adding a set of Poundstone curls at the end of one of the arm days, just for even more pump, and would throw in band pull aparts and lateral raises where I could find space for it.\n\n* For my 6th day, I ran through a ROM progression cycle of trap bar mat pulls, since I had a max trap bar lift coming up in my competition.  This was ultimately a 5 minute workout that I would frequently do without a warm-up.  After lifting was finished on each day, if I had any extra time, I’d do some short intense conditioning work.  I’d also do some sort of strongman training on Sundays: some sort of carry and load of some variety.  \n\n* On the 3rd week of the program, my schedule got compromised, so I ran the 3 day variant, and on the 6th week (current) my competition was at the end of the week, so I dropped my lifts back to their starting point and made it a point to move these (now) lighter weights fast and with short reps, as something of a mini-deload.  I actually think these might be good intentional decisions in the future.  They’re tools in the toolbox if nothing else.\n\n**WHAT I LIKED**\n\n* As much as I genuinely didn’t care for the arm days (I get up at the crack of dawn to train, and its hard to get motivated to do that when it’s JUST arms…), they are honestly a brilliant touch in the program overall, because they effectively give you an active recovery day between the BRUTALLY hard full body workouts.  I would be incredibly sore from the previous day, but wake up knowing I “just gotta do arms”, and then, by the next day, I was ready to train again.  And one of those arm days includes 20 minutes of non-stop bodyweight work, which I used as an opportunity to do burpee chins, which did a great job of getting some restorative bloodflow to the sore muscles and a touch of conditioning.\n\n* The timed squats are just plain awesome.  The weight is light and it encourages PR chasing, to say nothing of the lactic acid threshold benefit and the sheer anabolism that comes with it.  It’s also another great break between one day of heavy front squat triples and one day of heavy squat singles.  \n\n* On that, the variety of rep ranges and movements in general is just intelligent and awesome.  This is typical Jamie Lewis “Chaos and Pain” training: a great break if you’ve been doing the same thing for a while.  And since I was coming off of “Easy Strength”, that’s exactly what was happening.\n\n* HANGING LAT SHRUGS.  Oh my god that makes SO much sense.  You do 10 lat shrugs at the end of every set of hanging leg raises you do, and lat shrugs from a hang are so much more intuitive than trying to do them with dumbbells/barbells.  This is giving Paul Kelso his proper due.  And they’re very restorative.  Jamie does a great job of forcing me to do the things I SHOULD be doing, and that includes these lat shrugs, alongside all the direct arm and ab work.\n\n**WHAT I WOULD CHANGE**\n\n* Jamie has an arm day where you are to do skull crushers and reverse curls as a superset, using the same weight.  Jamie either has the strongest biceps ever or the weakest triceps, but for me, a weight I can reverse curl is too light for skull crushers, and trying to make this work was just square peg/round hole for me.  I came up with a bunch of tricks, but ultimately, when I run this again, I give myself permission to just use 2 different set ups.\n\n* My next run, I’ll probably bring the Safety Squat Bar in for that day of heavy squat singles.  I feel like the SSB better fits the “Yoke” portion of Juggeryoke, given how much it hammers the upper back.  I’ll most likely do SSB front squats too, just because my front rack is jacked up after 6 shoulder dislocations and toward the end of the program I had to deal with bar slippage issues.  \n\n**RESULTS**\n\n* You can see my physique in all the training videos.  In general, I’m more filled out in the areas I was lacking, which is awesome.\n\n* This program was GREAT for my horizontal pressing, as funny as that seems.  I went from 225 to 255 on my pause benching, and my dips went from 105 to 120.  I also went from 77 squats to 90 with 135.  My burpee chins each week tended to climb up, front squats went from 185 to 220 for the 10x3, etc etc.  All of my lifts went up: the program worked.\n\n**NUTRITION**\n\n* Nothing specifically prescribed by the program, but during this time I was using the nutrition protocol I laid out [here](https://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/2023/06/nutritional-alchemy-nutrition-post-part.html), which included a 5 day “mini-famine” in the 5th week, which allowed me to eat VERY big in the 6th week…which might also just be a good approach.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\n* This program is awesome.  Please buy and run it.",
