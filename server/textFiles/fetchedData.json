Our [FAQ][faq] covers many common questions; check that first. Also try searching old posts, either [via google][google] or via reddit's search.\n3. Your question isn't answered in the FAQ? Please read the following:\n\n## Getting debugging help\n\nIf your question is about code, make sure it's **specific** and **provides all information up-front**. Here's a checklist of what to include:\n\n1. A [**concise but descriptive title**][debugging-title].\n2. A [**good description**][debugging-description] of the problem.\n4.  A [**minimal**, **easily runnable**][debugging-posting], and [**well-formatted**][debugging-formatting] program that demonstrates your problem.\n5. The output you expected and what you got instead. If you got an error, include the **full** error message.\n\nDo your best to solve your problem before posting. The quality of the answers will be proportional to the amount of effort you put into your post. Note that title-only posts are automatically removed.\n\nAlso see [our full posting guidelines][debugging] and the [subreddit rules][rules]. After you post a question, **DO NOT** delete it!\n\n## Asking conceptual questions\n\nAsking conceptual questions is ok, but please check [our FAQ][faq] and search older posts first.\n\nIf you plan on asking a question similar to one in the FAQ, explain what exactly the FAQ didn't address and clarify what you're looking for instead. See our full guidelines on [asking conceptual questions][conceptual] for more details.\n\n## Subreddit rules\n\nPlease read [our rules][rules] and [other policies][policies] before posting.

As the title states, I am a software engineer with a few years of commercial experience gained in several companies, mainly as a backend developer.\n\nMy problem is, that I cannot comprehend LeetCode questions or other \"brain teasers\" (even for children). I am able to work without problems in my regular job, learn new frameworks, solve day to day problems, implement design patterns and all of this stuff. But ask me a question about how fast lake will be covered in plants if plant area doubles every 2 days and I am speechless.\n\nI understand how I can check string for palindrome, the algorythm behind that is easy for me. But for example if I would be tasked with something like this - [https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/) \\- \"Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.\" - I am dead.

In any other case, I would assume that I am not intelligent enough, not in a self depracating way, but simply stating my theory. But I feel like I am able to understand much harder things in my day to day work but those \"brain teasing\" questions, are somehow, extremely abstract for me.\n\nAnd it's kinda fascinating for me, because I tried to compare myself with my friends. And a lot of those brain teasers that I am not able to solve, are solved pretty fast by my friends that don't work in technical fields at all. I would even risk the statement, that children are better than me in those questions.\n\nI am wondering, if there is more people like me? Is there any \"approach\" that I could take to fight with this abstract questions? Should I buy myself a riddle book for grade schoolers?\n\nShould I change my way of thinking about this or there is no other way that throwing those exercises at myself hoping that finally something will \"click\"?",

After being laid off twice at the start of this year and sending out many targeted applications for positions I qualify for, I cannot get a single interview. I have a bit under two years of experience now but cannot get anyone's attention. The job market has hugely shriveled up and entry level jobs have become just about impossible to find. Even the rare post titled \"entry level\" often requires many years of experience. This is not a competitive market. It is an impossible market, at least for me. I for one cannot live like that so I had to transition to another career field (nurse assisting). If the market recovers then I can look again but I am not holding my breath for this field anymore. If anyone tells you that this is your fault and you just need to regroup and approach it differently or be \"more competitive\" (as if everyone else is not being just as competitive as you are) then they are wrong; it's not you; this market is dead. You can blame people or  circumstances or whatever, but the field is shrinking and if 10,000 people are looked for 2,000 jobs then no matter how hard they compete, 80% of people won't be getting a job (I don't know actual numbers, this is just an example).\n\nI want to be clear that it is still good to seek out advice and give advice on how to stay more competitive. But for me personally, my mental health / spiritual wellbeing / whatever you want to call it just can't take it any more. Many other people are in the same boat. If you want to keep looking, feel free. For me, I switched to nurse assisting and I am very happy about that decision. I am very very tired of applying for jobs I will never get, of getting literally zero interviews after many many many applications, of feeling unwanted and worthless all the time. I am very tired of holding out hope and being given false hope or being told that if I just sprinkle more networking and \"competitive\" dust on everything I will finally break through.

The internet is irrelevant to the products.\n\nSo I feel very behind in terms of my skills. On my own I’ve built a couple full stack apps with React and I’ve dabbled in AWS. I’m not clueless when it comes to dev methodologies, testing, and other DevOps things, but I have no professional experience with it.\n\nAll things considered I have a pretty good resume and I do get callbacks. I just feel like I get passed on because of my lack of relevant experience in certain aforementioned areas.\n\nI’m wondering how I can give myself the best chance to get a job at a company that actually takes software seriously. Currently I have my best project on my resume and I’m working on getting it deployed and on my GitHub. I’m also familiar with a lot of methodologies and tools being used in the industry. Besides that, is there anything else I can do to bridge the gap between my professional experience and my potential to do well at a company that actually has defined practices and actually uses modern technology? Maybe an AWS certification?\n\nThank you!",

I rarely get callbacks even after 1000+ applications (not using LinkedIn easyApply but applying on company site). I've probably sent in over 2000 applications total. Sometimes I don't even make it past the phone screen but I've since tried to be more enthusiastic when talking to recruiters and demonstrate knowledge about the company and it's mission so I seem like a great fit. I've also worked on sounding more professional and just coming across as someone who recruiters would like to hire, as well as being able to relate my experiences to the job description in a clear and eloquent way while demonstrating a history of working well in challenging and collaborative environments as a good employee.\n\nI got ghosted by Citi, bombed my Capital One powerday, botched my Google technical interview, and have failed several phone screens. I've been working on leetcode and tried to prepare for system design interviews because I knew that was coming on Capital One powerday.\n\nThis is the part that is messing with my head. I want to find a regular job to hold me over so I can get out of the house and not sit around all day alone applying to jobs. Plus I need money for food so I don't have to ask my parents to support me with literally 0 income. But I can't even manage to do that.\n\nIt took me months to find any job at all after being laid off, like 3 months of applying to random jobs that don't require any experience. I eventually found a job as a computer assembler that paid 20 an hour but they fired me on the second day because I didn't demonstrate competency even though I told them in the interview that I had no experience and they said that it was fine, I could train on the job.\n\nI found a job at a sandwich shop a few months later but I they've reduced my hours and it's not enough to live on, it seems that they're are probably going to fire me. I can't find a job as a grocery store clerk, server, cook, food prep, dishwasher, janitor, or literally doing anything. I tried to find an electrician apprentice job but they didn't want me. I tried to find a job working in fast food or at a burger place and they also didn't want me. I went to multiple temp agencies asking for LITERALLY ANY FULLTIME JOB and they took one look at my resume and said that they had nothing for me. I asked about the factory and warehouse jobs and they said that those require experience. I asked if I could train on the job and if experience is a hard requirement and they said it's not possible.\n\nIf I can't find a software job in 6 months I understand that the market is tough. But what's driving me crazy, literally to the point where I just want to end it all is that I can't find a job doing anything. Walmart won't even fucking hire me. Just let me scan groceries or wash dishes or work as a landscaper or do literally anything. I would do literally anything. I would work as a janitor at this point. No one wants me for anything. I don't understand why. I think I interview fine and come off as someone enthusiastic who literally just wants to work but no one wants me. I can't believe it. I just can't believe. I can't find a job at McDonald's or Steak n Shake or even Panera Bread, they won't even let me sweep floors or do anything. I've applied to every software job and every other job in general and somehow I can't find or do shit. I interview fine and have great social skills but I just can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. I need to find a job doing something.\n\nThere's probably no one else in this sad of a position, but I would appreciate any advice. Please critique my resume. Or give me advice on how to find literally any job, because applying to everything on LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, and Indeed hasn't worked. Hitting up college buddies for referrals hasn't worked. Recruiters give me hope when they contact me but they ghost me after the phone screen.\n\nthey won't hire me for anything, there is no way the market is this bad, I just can't believe it. I'm so desperate for literally any minimum wage job doing literally anything. If I can't find a software job for now I can tough it out and persevere and spend time preparing through leetcode and personal projects as well as brushing up on things like data structures, system design, web dev, and design patterns. But if I can't find a job doing ANYTHING, literally ANYTHING...I just don't know what to think of myself. This is so pathetic of me. How can I be such a failure at something so basic. How can I not find a job doing anything. I just don't understand. I just don't understand. I'll jump off a bridge before I spend another 3 months not being able to find ANYTHING. How can my family not be ashamed of me if I can't find a job doing literally ANYTHING. What the fuck am I doing wrong.",

My partner was accepted into a PhD program away from where we were living and working and I decided to go with her and support her. Initially I thought I could take my position remote but then my company was purchased by a larger company and they halted all commitments to new remote positions leaving me in a bad situation.I decided that with all the money I had saved up, and my experience that I would take the risk of leaving my job and moving with her to find something else.That has not gone well so far. I had a few interviews in the beginning, and some went well but none ended up with offers I was willing to take (wanted me to relocate to another place other than where I just relocated). Its been 2+ months of applying for me now, 200+ applications. Most of the positions I find on LinkedIn and Indeed. I usually meet all the basic requirements, lots I feel I would be the ideal candidate. I haven't gotten a single interview since those first 2 weeks. I have revamped my resume with the help of my partner recently and still nothing.I am definitely growing more frustrated as time passes. Money isn't the real concern here. Boredom is. I need to work soon or else I fear going crazy.\n\nIs applying to postings online just not the way to go anymore? Do I have to find some something through a recruiter?

        "selfText": "TLDR: I have a software degree with experience in web development, design, and digital marketing (and a lot in-between). I know how to do a lot of things somewhat well. I'm very good at picking things up on the spot, but I definitely lack deep knowledge in any one single area. Now, in this job market, I'm struggling to find anything.\n\nSmall businesses love me, but I can't get a decent-paying job at a decent company for the life of me. I graduated with a bachelor's in Software Development over 4 years ago but had trouble finding a job afterward. I landed myself into a somewhat technical project at a non-technical company, but I was bored and wanted more, so I went part-time with them and started my own website agency having never built a full website in my life.\n\nHonestly, it didn't go so bad. This is when I learned that I also have a knack for web design, so I built a couple websites for a couple of small businesses before picking up a contract-to-hire remote Junior Web Developer role. I learned a ton and actually successfully finished a lot of tickets with no pushback. But I got covid for a couple of weeks, and then came back and fucked up a merge, so they decided to end the contract two months in. I later learned from my recruiter that they did the same thing to several other contract-to-hires in different departments. Who knows, maybe she just wanted me to feel better.\n\nI must be great at selling myself because, soon after, I somehow landed a role as a senior-level UI/UX Designer at a local company (they liked my website designs that much I guess). I thought things were going great. I helped them adopt Figma and increase the accessibility of their customer portal. But they \"laid me off\" after a month because they \"weren't able to secure funding for the position\". Who knows. Again, I think these people just want to make me feel better.\n\nI found a few more clients after that to help keep us afloat. I created more design systems on Figma, created a couple more websites, and taught myself different CMSs. I picked up a Shopify client and we hit it off. We decided to make it a permanent full-time position where I would continue to manage and optimize the website, as well as lead 100% of our digital marketing efforts. What I later learned is that their business model wasn't sustainable. They were in a space where they profited big during covid, but they had practically zero profit margin and orders had started to plummet before I even came on. I take full responsibility for not recognizing this earlier. They eventually realized this too, so they pivoted  the company and laid me off. I actually still contract with them to manage their website, but now I'm back to ground zero.\n\nSo now what? I have a software degree with this broad, yet non-marketable skill set. Small companies like to hire generalists (like my last role) because they can't afford full teams. Larger companies look at my doozy of a resume and pass. For any positions I got laid off from, I just put that experience under my freelancing business.\n\nI like being a generalist because I love to learn how everything works and wear a lot of hats, but I have a wife and three kids and need a sustainable income. Has anyone else had a successful career doing what I do? What helped you in your career? If not, maybe it's time I lean into one area and embrace it.",

However the number of obvious GPT comment bots is rising and will quickly become untenable for the number of active moderators we have.\n\nThere are some topics such as Code of Conduct arguments within projects that I don't know where to place where we've been doing a civility check on the comments thread and using that to make the decision.

The rules as written are pretty vague and the way we're moderating in practise is only loosely connected to them. We're looking for feedback on what kind of place r/programming should be so tell us below.\n\n**We need additional mods**. If you're interested in helping moderate **please post below, saying why you'd be a good mod and what you'd would change about the space if you were**. You don't need to be a moderator elsewhere but please do mention it if you are and what we could learn on r/programming that you already know. Currently I think I'm the only one going down the new page every morning and removing the rule-breaking posts. (Today these are mostly \"how do I program computer\" or \"can somebody help me fix my printer\", and obvious spam.) This results in a lot of threads complaining about the moderation quality and, well, it's not wrong. I'm not rigorously watching the mod queue and I'm not trawling comments threads looking for bad actors unless I'm in that thread anyway and I don't use reddit every single day. So if we want it to be better we'll need more human power.\n\n# FAQ: Why do we need moderation at all? Can't the votes just do it?\n\nWe know there is demand for unmoderated spaces in the world, but r/programming isn't that space. This is our theory on why keeping the subreddit on topic is important:\n\n* Forums have the interesting property that **whatever is on the front page today is what will be on the front page tomorrow**. When a user comes to the site and sees a set of content, they believe that that's what this website is about. If they like it they'll stay and contribute that kind of content and if they don't like it they won't stay, leaving only the people that liked the content they saw yesterday. So the seed content is important and keeping things on topic is important. If you like r/programming then you need moderation to keep it the way that you like it (or make it be the place you wish it were) because otherwise entropic drift will make it be a different place. And once you have moderation it's going to have a subjective component, that's just the nature of it.\n* Because of the way reddit works, on a light news day r/programming doesn't get enough daily content for articles to meaningfully compete with each other. Towards the end of the day if I post something to r/programming it will immediately go to the front page of all r/programming subscribers. So while it's true that sub-par and rule-breaking posts already do most of their damage before the mods even see them, the whole theory of posts competing via votes alone doesn't really work in a lower-volume subreddit.\n* Because of the mechanics of moderation it's not really possible to allow the subreddit to be say 5% support questions. Even if we wanted to allow it to be a small amount of the conten, the individuals whose content was removed would experience and perceive this as a punitive action against them. That means that any category we allow could theoretically completely take over r/programming (like the career posts from last week) so we should only allow types of content that we'd be okay with taking it over.\n\nPersonally my dream is for r/programming to be the place with the highest quality programming content, where I can go to read something interesting and learn something new every day. That dream is at odds with allowing every piece of blogspam and \"10 ways to convince your boss to give you a raise, #2 will get you fired!\"",

I'm not the most experienced programmer, so I need things to be kept simple, if possible.\n\nI'm wondering..\n1. What kind of software or tools do I need to build Aila? I'm a bit lost here. I'm currently using Cody AI with GPT-3.5 turbo but its not perfect.\n2. Are there any good online courses or tutorials for a beginner like me? Something simple and easy to understand would be perfect.\n3. How can I make Aila talk and sound friendly, like a real person with rich personality? I want her to be approachable and nice. I tried deferent prompts but I cant make her get out of the customer support chatbot role.\n4. Any advice on making Aila understand emotions and have a sense of humor? I want her to be able to connect with people.\n5. I have this dream of Aila tweeting and posting photos on her own. It sounds ambitious, but I'm hopeful.\n6. What are some cool features I can add to make Aila more fun and engaging for users? Any ideas?\n7. Initially, I want to run Aila for free. cause currently there's no way for me to make any money off her.\n\nI'd really appreciate any advice or tips you guys can give me. Please keep it simple and easy to understand.

For someone at my level of training, I value simplicity more than the exact specifics, so I wanted to dumb down the \"phases\" of the traditional juggernaut and replace them with a simple extra set/extra volume. The exact \"program\" was the following:\n\n||10's|8's|5's|3's|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Week 1|3 sets|3 sets|3 sets|3 sets|\n|Week 2|4 sets|4 sets|4 sets|4 sets|\n|Week 3|5 sets|5 sets|5 sets|5 sets|\n|Week 4|Deload|Deload|Deload|Deload|\n\nEvery set was done at as close to RPE 8 as possible, so the weights were adjusted based on how it was moving each day.\n\n**10's/8's waves:**  \nI had never done high-rep squats or deadlifts before, but for squats and deadlifts, the high-rep phases felt more effective than the high-intensity ones. I felt like my body was able to recover the quickest from these 10's and 8's sessions, even though they are technically the highest volume. I had no problems training legs 3 times per week, or bench 2 days in a row during the first couple of months. I wouldn't make any changes to this part of the training in the future. Had I tested my maxes the day my 8's wave ended, I don't think my maxes would look drastically different from what they ended up being.\n\n**5's/3's phase:**  \nThe 5's and 3's waves were noticeably harder to recover from, and there would be some sessions where I'd go in knowing I wasn't going to be able to do what I theoretically could do given an extra couple days of rest. At the start of the program, I could train basically whenever I wanted, but by the end, not only was I having to specifically plan out the number of days between squat and deadlift, but I was also having to make sure I came in fully carbed and fully hydrated, or else I felt like I didn't get a good session. In the future, I think it might be wiser to do either lower volume (I.E. stay at 3 sets rather than jumping to 4 or 5) or take my intensity down to an RPE 6-7. I might honestly not even do the 3's phase next time I run this program, as I don't feel as if I got any benefit from it in terms of actual strength building (I felt like the 3's were more for the CNS than anything). If I ever wanted to actually peak, I think in the future it would be wiser to run a true peaking program rather than run the 3's wave of this juggernaut.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**  \nI really liked this program overall, and I can't complain about what I got out of it. I will absolutely be running this again, with the main adjustment being the removal of the 3's wave, and resetting back to 10's once I finish 5's. I am still relatively new to powerlifting, but I hope there are some good takeaways others can take from this. I'm very open to hearing feedback and suggestions!",

        "selfText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background:**\n\nThis was my second meet at 90kg (down from 100), first WRPF meet and first time ever travelling for a meet.  Also as I turn 40 next year, my last year competing as a Sub-master 35-39.\n\n**Prep:**\n\nThis was my first meet where I really had gotten to focus in with my coach Jake Benson and have a lot of prep time to build up for this.  From my last dexa scan done a few years ago vs one week before my meet we had dropped 12lbs of body fat and put on almost 1lb of LBM.  Jake does some \"unconventional\" things compared to other coaches with his programming but I just decided I was going to trust the process and dive in.\n\nSince I'm almost 40, my body just cannot train squats more than once per week under the bar, so we did a ton of conditioning type work and used other methods like plyometric work to focus on better performance on the platform. This was easily the best shape I have ever been in and all of our work payed off.\n\nBench was by far the best feeling lift going into this meet, which is normally the opposite for me.  Prior  meets I had been absolutely destroyed with shoulder/elbow/bicep pain that had a big impact on bench.  I had not PRd bench in almost 3 years.  We focused a lot on all sorts of fatigue/ intensity specific variations that allowed me to not have to work under high loads but still make progress.  It was really weird at first but I knew we were on to something about 8 weeks out when I hit 5kg less than my old max for a double at RPE 7.\n\nMy biggest struggle with deadlift has been just being exhausted by the time DLs roll around.  So again a lot of the conditioning / hypoxia work really benefited me here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Meet:**\n\nI weighed in at 89.0kg and immediately started my rehydration protocols.  I was in the afternoon flight for the first time ever which was miserable for weigh ins, but awesome for the meet day as I could actually sleep the night before not having to be up early.\n\nSquat warmups were a bit hectic, we were competing on Monos but everyone was warming up on combo racks.  I am not used to the mono and so I felt not great about having to squat out of one.  I did choose to walk out because I was not confident in just picking from the mono and going from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Attempts**  [https://www.instagram.com/p/Cxl1Xm6y\\_lU/](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cxl1Xm6y_lU/) here are all my 3rd attempts\n\nSQUAT: 205kg/452lbs ✅ 215kg/474lbs ✅ 222.5kg/491lbs ✅\n\nMy first 2 attempts I also didn't have the mono at the right height and it was really difficult to get setup under the bar making those attempts harder than they should have been.  The third attempt felt much better at the right height.  I learned I really do not like squatting out of a mono, and Kabuki bars feel not great and want to roll forward on you.\n\nThis was a PR for me at 90kg and a state/national record for my weight/age class.\n\nBENCH: 155kg/342lbs ✅ 167.5kg/369lbs ✅ 175kg/386lbs ✅\n\nAfter my opener I knew I was going to have a big bench day.  I asked Jake if I could just get my PR on attempt 2 so I went 2.5kg over my all time PR and it flew off the chest.  I was so happy to finally have a PR I didn't really know where to go for the 3rd.  We settled on 175kg which was just 2.5kg under the national record, but knew it should be safe for me to hit.  I smoked it and started laughing halfway up at how easy I got it.\n\nDEADLIFTS:\n\n240kg/529lbs ✅ 255kg/562lbs ✅ 262.5kg/579lbs ✅\n\nMost I’ve ever done in comp was 260kg so I just wanted to beat that.  I was definitely still feeling fatigue by this point but after hitting 255 knew a PR would be there.  Can't say thanks enough to /u/Sully100 for all your help getting me through deads.\n\nThis was a meet PR for me and a state and national record for my weight/age class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Reflection:** This was by far the most fun meet I have ever had.  The group of guys competing were all amazing and supportive.  The staff was so helpful and going 9/9 with PRs on everything was just the perfect meet.  I set 4 state records and 3 national records ( just missed bench).  I can't wait to do it again next year in the master's division.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext up for me is a real focus on getting my squat back up over my 100kg **BW** total.  I want to get to 450dots and a 700kg total at 90kg, which seems very achievable after this meet.  So we will keep progressing bench and put a real focus on my quads and squat improvements.",

        "selfText": "**Some background before the background:** Alex Bromeley had released the concept of this program approximately 9 months ago, and released the full template for free, on his YouTube channel, alongside an e-book for purchase. I will disclose: I had purchased the book, as I generally enjoy his content overall and wanted to continue to support his work. You can find his videos here:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj3Mq91hZEQ&amp;t=129s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj3Mq91hZEQ&amp;t=129s) \\-first video, discusses the ideologies, and thought process behind the program.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuRM2EkMctU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuRM2EkMctU) \\- video two, the actual program with sets and reps laid out.\n\n**Training history and back ground:**\n\nI (M31, 5'11) started lifting around college. The term \"lifting\" could probably be used loosely as I had no idea what I was doing in the early days. At that time I had a woman I was dating write me a very simple exercise program, just to get myself in the gym and to be more active, as I was mostly sedentary well into my 20's. Following that time of my life, I got very much into pursuing more strength , over aesthetics, and that lead me to programs that aligned with more of that desire, some programs of honorable mention have been basic 5x5 progressions, a brief stint with 5/3/1 and its variants, Juggernaut and a highly bastardized version of conjugate leading into those dark times of covid shut down back in 2020.\n\nFollowing the return the gym after nearly a full year hiatus, I got highly focused on the pursuit of strength numbers again. In the middle of 2022 I hit a major stall in progress with an approximately 220lb bench, 430lb deadlift, 350 lb. squat and a 135 lb. OHP. That stall lead me to hiring a coach, as well as seeking more information on my own, and after a year I had broken through the plateau as well as lost some body fat, but nothing that warranted keeping that coach further. So I moved on in approximately May of 2023. However this lead to my dilemma of figuring out what my next steps would be.\n\nI was feeling pretty banged up from all the strength work/low reps, and my joint were begging for mercy, I definitely felt another stall on the horizon, and knew I needed to change up my approach if I wanted to continue to make something happen. At the time I had read base strength and peak strength and knew I wanted to follow something to that effect, but also knew I needed a longer reprieve in the base building territory, and needed more time away from the basic lifts I'd been grinding for almost a year. So I opted to follow Kong.\n\n**The Program:**\n\nTo sum up in a very short and condensed package, Kong is a 12 week program that is broken up into three blocks that follow a week to week progression scheme based on ascending RPE, and small tweaks in reps and sets. This also follows his pretty standard approach to volumizing as well often with sets being added the deeper into the blocks you get. Its a five day per week program, breaking up the body in different ways block to block. I could outline it here further for you, but if this sounds like your interest I'd just watch the video, after all these folks are more articulate than me anyway.\n\n**Diet**:\n\nI was tracking food an eating in a slight surplus i was shooting on average 250-400 calories above maintenance, and I typically opt for more carbs in general- I felt really good going into my evening work out times, and was definitely well fed. I am not a nutritionist I will not advise what you should do.\n\nResults:\n\nGiven that the goal of the program is mass, and not strength numbers I will share I thought this was very successful for me I had started the program weighing in at 205lbs on average and ended with an average of around 212lbs, I will apologize I did not take progress pictures, as I was not planning on writing a review at the time. Areas that I personally grew: my shoulders REALLY blocked out and widened as did my lats, my triceps also got some additional growth that was noticeable from other reports. My quads also grew enough I needed to buy some new pants, so there is that...\n\n**Some thoughts for each block, and then overall thoughts and :**\n\nBlock 1: This block was the hardest for me personally, this is also where the exercise selection feels the most broad. Reps are typically in the 15-20 rep range on week one, and taper down to sets of 10 and 12 at RPE 10. There were a lot of movements I was either very inexperienced in or very unfamiliar with i.e. JM presses and behind the neck presses to name a couple. I was also very unfamiliar with gauging RPE at this point, and throughout the program RPE never quite made sense logically in my head, so I was overreaching a lot in the RPE department, this will become a theme for each block ESPECIALLY on the leg days.\n\nBlock 2: This is where I think I personally hit my stride with the program as it was primarily movements I have done a lot of work with and had good ball park numbers to go off of. In this block it is a lot of disadvantaged movements, followed by similar movement pattern exercises and additional accessories in a pyramid fashion, still utilizing RPE as the primary metric. RPE was starting to click on upper body days really well, and I was pretty frequently on target , or just a slight undershoot, but always left feeling pretty solid. Lower body days were still hell and proceeded to give me a lot of grief. I was not being accustomed to the level of volume specifically around knee flexion due to a lot of squatting, leg extensions, and single leg exercises. My left knee started to become very irritated, with the familiar sting of tendonitis. This is also where I screwed up, instead of letting of the gas, and correcting my volume leading into block three, I maintained course and speed annnnnd that was a big big mistake on my end.\n\nBlock 3:\n\nWe now switch from disadvantaged movements, to very much overloaded types of movement, for top sets followed by back off work and I will say,,, bromely said in the book to let it fly, and I took that statement as a personal challenge. Some fun accomplishments was a push press at 185 for a top triple, a wide grip bench in which I three RM'd my old 1 rep max (240lbs), and a quite lovely 13inch deadlift that was 465 for 5. You will notice you will not see a squat here, that is because due to the patellar tendonitis issues and some degree of compensation for that, my hips and IT band decided to ignite on fire, resulting in some of the most painful lateral knee pain I have ever experienced , and continues to be an issue for me right now as I write this. This is most likely due to weeks and weeks of misgauging rpe and not knowing just how much effort I was putting into some of these work outs.\n\nOverall :\n\ndespite injury during this program was a lot of fun to run, it had so much variety , and so much new movement that it felt like I was in newbie gains all over again! The volume feels manageable when you factor in eating and getting adequate rest. I think that if you have committed to strength for a long time, like I have this can be a nice and refreshing change of pace. I am currently finding it carrying over very nicely now that I am running bullmastiff at the current moment. I was very pleased with my results and continue to be pleased.\n\nSome things I would have done differently, I would have probably wanted to touch some of the exercises that I have never done before for some top sets, prior to running the program to have a general idea of what weight I could handle. In the last few months I have come across, MIke Tuchscherer's RPE chart, and would probably want to use that as general tool to \"be in the ball park\" for weight selection, as I was generally basing most of my weigh choices of of variations that I did know. I think this is also what lead to me frequently over shooting my RPE.\n\nOverall, I will run it again in the future, my intention will be to run it when/if I feel I need a more prolonged base phase and when I think I need more time to broaden out and get more variety.\n\nIf you have any more specific questions I would love to answer them! But I would strongly recommend his material on the program!",
