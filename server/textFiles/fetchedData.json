We'll leave this stickied for a few days to gather feedback.\n\nHere are the broad categories of content that we see, along with whether they are **currently** allowed. ‚úÖ means that it's currently allowed, üö´ means that it's not currently allowed, ‚ö†Ô∏è means that we leave it up if it is already popular but if we catch it young in its life we do try to remove it early.\n\n* ‚úÖ Actual programming content. They probably have actual code in them. Language or library writeups, papers, technology descriptions. How an allocator works. How my new fancy allocator I just wrote works. How our startup built our Frobnicator, rocket ship emoji. For many years this was the only category of allowed content.\n* ‚úÖ Programming news. ChatGPT can write code. A big new CVE just dropped. Curl 8.01 released now with Coffee over IP support.\n* ‚úÖ Programmer career content. How to become a Staff engineer in 30 days. Habits of the best engineering managers. How to deal with your annoying coworkers, *Jeff*.\n* ‚úÖ Articles/news interesting *to* programmers but not about programming. Work from home is bullshit. Return to office is bullshit. There's a Steam sale on programming games. Terry Davis has died. How to SCRUMM. App Store commissions are going up. How to hire a more diverse development team. Interviewing programmers is broken.\n* ‚ö†Ô∏è General technology news. Google buys its last competitor. A self driving car hit a pedestrian. Twitter is collapsing. Oculus accidentally showed your grandmother a penis. Github sued when Copilot produces the complete works of Harry Potter in a code comment. Meta cancels work from home. Gnome dropped a feature I like. How to run Stable Diffusion to generate pictures of, uh, cats, yeah it's definitely just for cats. A bitcoin VR metaversed my AI and now my app store is mobile social local.\n* üö´ Politics. The Pirate Party is winning in Sweden. Please vote for net neutrality. Big Tech is being sued in Europe for *gestures broadly*.\n* üö´ Gossip. Richard Stallman switches to Windows. Elon Musk farted. Linus Torvalds was a poopy-head on a mailing list. Grace Hopper Conference is now 60% male. The People's Rust Foundation is arguing with the Rust Foundation For The People. Terraform has been forked into Terra and Form. Stack Overflow sucks now. Stack Overflow is good actually.\n* ‚úÖ Demos with code. I wrote a game, here it is on GitHub\n* üö´ Demos without code. I wrote a game, come buy it! Please give me feedback on my startup (totally not an ad nosirree). I stayed up all night writing a commercial text editor, here's the pricing page. I made a DALL-E image generator. I made the fifteenth animation of A* this week, here's a GIF.\n* üö´ AskReddit type forum questions. What's your favourite programming language? Tabs or spaces? Does anyone else hate it when.\n* üö´ Support questions. How do I write a web crawler? How do I get into programming? Where's my missing semicolon? Please do this obvious homework problem for me. Personally I feel very strongly about not allowing these because they'd quickly drown out all of the actual content I come to see, and there are already much more effective places to get them answered anyway. In real life the quality of the ones that we see is also universally very low.\n* üö´ Surveys and üö´ Job postings and anything else that is looking to extract value from a place a lot of programmers hang out without contributing anything itself.\n* üö´ Meta posts. DAE think r/programming sucks? Why did you remove my post? Why did you ban this user that is totes not me I swear I'm just asking questions. Except this meta post. This one is okay because I'm a tyrant that the rules don't apply to (I assume you are saying about me to yourself right now).\n* üö´ Images, memes, anything low-effort or low-content. Thankfully we very rarely see any of this so there's not much to remove but like support questions once you have a few of these they tend to totally take over because it's easier to make a meme than to write a paper and also easier to vote on a meme than to read a paper.\n* ‚ö†Ô∏è Posts that we'd normally allow but that are obviously, unquestioningly super low quality like blogspam copy-pasted onto a site with a bazillion ads. It has to be pretty bad before we remove it and even then sometimes these are the first post to get traction about a news event so we leave them up if they're the best discussion going on about the news event. There's a lot of grey area here with CVE announcements in particular: there are a lot of spammy security \"blogs\" that syndicate stories like this.\n* ‚ö†Ô∏è Posts that are duplicates of other posts or the same news event. We leave up either the first one or the healthiest discussion.\n* ‚ö†Ô∏è Posts where the title editorialises too heavily or especially is a lie or conspiracy theory.\n* Comments are only very loosely moderated and it's mostly üö´ Bots of any kind (Beep boop you misspelled misspelled!) and üö´ Incivility (You idiot, everybody knows that my favourite toy is better than your favourite toy.) However the number of obvious GPT comment bots is rising and will quickly become untenable for the number of active moderators we have.\n\nThere are some topics such as Code of Conduct arguments within projects that I don't know where to place where we've been doing a civility check on the comments thread and using that to make the decision. Similarly some straddle the line (a link to a StackOverflow post asking for help and the reddit OP is the StackOverflow OP, but there's a lot of technical content and the reddit discussion is healthy). And even most üö´s above are left up if there's a healthy discussion going already by the time we see it.\n\n# So what now?\n\nWe need to decide **what r/programming should be about** and we need to write those rules down so that mods can consistently apply them. The rules as written are pretty vague and the way we're moderating in practise is only loosely connected to them. We're looking for feedback on what kind of place r/programming should be so tell us below.\n\n**We need additional mods**. If you're interested in helping moderate **please post below, saying why you'd be a good mod and what you'd would change about the space if you were**. You don't need to be a moderator elsewhere but please do mention it if you are and what we could learn on r/programming that you already know. Currently I think I'm the only one going down the new page every morning and removing the rule-breaking posts. (Today these are mostly \"how do I program computer\" or \"can somebody help me fix my printer\", and obvious spam.) This results in a lot of threads complaining about the moderation quality and, well, it's not wrong. I'm not rigorously watching the mod queue and I'm not trawling comments threads looking for bad actors unless I'm in that thread anyway and I don't use reddit every single day. So if we want it to be better we'll need more human power.\n\n# FAQ: Why do we need moderation at all? Can't the votes just do it?\n\nWe know there is demand for unmoderated spaces in the world, but r/programming isn't that space. This is our theory on why keeping the subreddit on topic is important:\n\n* Forums have the interesting property that **whatever is on the front page today is what will be on the front page tomorrow**. When a user comes to the site and sees a set of content, they believe that that's what this website is about. If they like it they'll stay and contribute that kind of content and if they don't like it they won't stay, leaving only the people that liked the content they saw yesterday. So the seed content is important and keeping things on topic is important. If you like r/programming then you need moderation to keep it the way that you like it (or make it be the place you wish it were) because otherwise entropic drift will make it be a different place. And once you have moderation it's going to have a subjective component, that's just the nature of it.\n* Because of the way reddit works, on a light news day r/programming doesn't get enough daily content for articles to meaningfully compete with each other. Towards the end of the day if I post something to r/programming it will immediately go to the front page of all r/programming subscribers. So while it's true that sub-par and rule-breaking posts already do most of their damage before the mods even see them, the whole theory of posts competing via votes alone doesn't really work in a lower-volume subreddit.\n* Because of the mechanics of moderation it's not really possible to allow the subreddit to be say 5% support questions. Even if we wanted to allow it to be a small amount of the conten, the individuals whose content was removed would experience and perceive this as a punitive action against them. That means that any category we allow could theoretically completely take over r/programming (like the career posts from last week) so we should only allow types of content that we'd be okay with taking it over.\n\nPersonally my dream is for r/programming to be the place with the highest quality programming content, where I can go to read something interesting and learn something new every day. That dream is at odds with allowing every piece of blogspam and \"10 ways to convince your boss to give you a raise, #2 will get you fired!\"",

        "selfText": "So here's my situation, I'm expecting to graduate in the Fall next year, but my college requires us to get an internship to graduate.\n\nThere's a career fair on Thursday. I'm assuming there may be other companies there that might be willing to be open for CS students even though they're looking for Business majors primarily since my school is popular for Business students.\n\nThe problem is, is there's only 4 companies there specifically for CS internships, there's around over a hundred companies coming to the career fair, but only 4 are listed for CS majors on Handshake. And since CS is extremely competitive, my chances of getting considered are slim to none if there truly is going to only be 4 companies looking for CS majors.\n\nAnd my college's career center does not help you find internships you have to find it yourself, AND I have to pay $1,200 for the internship credit to count to graduate, with the school not helping at all with finding internships. Pretty much apply to any and all internship postings and hope I get a call back. \n\nDoes anyone know what to do in this situation? I'm stuck here, why am I required to pay $1,200 for the internship to count to graduate when the school doesn't do anything to help me find internships? Shit doesn't make sense\n\nI rather use that $1,200 for a research class as a replacement over internship since that's what my friend did at his school, but that's not an option for mine... And I find it highly unlikely to land an internship by Summer if there really is only going to be 4 companies for CS majors at this career fair. So I might not be able to graduate if I can't get an internship on time by the Summer \n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention, I live in west Michigan, so this area of Michigan isn't that good for tech jobs in general either way. Relocation is an option but that's only an absolute last resort if I have no other option. I've considered apprenticeships like Revature, Accenture and Genspark but for some reason they've stopped accepting new people this year.",

Felt smarter than everyone else. Already had a 4.0 GPA.\n\nI thought, \"Wow, I bet I could be Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk.\"\n\nKept learning. Kept building.\n\nParents found out. They were overjoyed. Their little boy was gonna be rich and be a titan of industry.\n\nI believed them. I thought, \"Wow, I must be really really good at this.\"\n\nTook the ACT. Got a 21. Then a 24. Took it 2 more times. 24 both times. \n\nNo matter. ACT doesn't define me. I'm still super smart. \n\nCouldn't get into Ivy league anymore though. Didn't qualify for any scholarships. Had to stay in-state.\n\nBut that's ok. I'd be better than everyone in college. I'd get recognized.\n\nThe science-based classes were hard. Very hard. Failed a bunch of tests. Was a mediocre student in my CS classes. Nothing came naturally.\n\nI was tired. Had no interest in joining campus organizations. Just wanted to forget about coding the second I walked out of the lecture hall or finished a homework assignment.\n\nChanged my mind and joined an aerospace organization that was building a satellite. I was supposed to help build the ground station. Cool stuff. The project never went anywhere. Complete waste of effort.\n\nHad trouble making friends in college. Got sad a lot. Felt confused a lot. Wondered why I put so much of my confidence into this whole \"I'll be the next Mark Zuckerberg\" thing.\n\nWas already a senior. I liked movies, drawing, music, and photography.

The offer was primarily due to the fact that I listed the satellite student organization I was a part of on my resume. \n\nYa know, the project that never went anywhere and was a complete waste of time? Yea, that's the reason I have a job right now. \n\nI do ok at work. Got promoted. Got a raise. I'm a decent engineer now. Have no right to complain. Not on track to be the boy wonder or anything. Would still like to work on something cool at some point. Still have lots of ideas. \n\nNot sure if I want to do this forever. If I was really good at it, I think I'd be more motivated. I'm still tired. I think what I want is to just do something important or interesting.\n\nTherapist says I'm too hard on myself.

I had been working in state government for the past two years with the title of software developer and then application developer because the state decided to change what they call us. I had planned to work this job for the next thirty years or so until I could retire. \n\nBut a week ago, the director of the department called me and said, \"it's not working out\" and then proceeded to say that I was being dismissed effective immediately. This was a big shock to me because I had a good track record for the most part. A few months ago, my supervisor (not the director) gave me a bit of a verbal reprimand for being slow and not asking for help with a specific project I was building from scratch. We discussed it and I felt like it was well resolved. After this discussion, in July, I had my annual evaluation where I was praised and given a merit based pay increase. \n\nThen on August 1st, my \"wife\" (we were separated at the time and heading for a divorce and lengthy custody battle) suddenly died. Her dad found her in her apartment. So since this is my daughter's mom, my best friend for 14 years, and up until recently my life partner, I think I've been struggling a lot with my mental health and depression. My supervisor made it clear that I need to prioritize myself and my daughter. I could take as much time as I needed and I could take time with a moments notice without worry. \n\nSo I'd been doing that. Trying my best to be both a good employee, a good dad, a grieving widower, and also taking care of my own mental and physical health. \n\nSo when I was told it wasn't working out, I was surprised. It had been told to me since the beginning of my employment that nothing should ever come as a surprise. So when I mentioned this, the director told me that if I think back on my conversations, it would probably become clear to me. And I have been....still confused. I've never heard of a firing from government like this without prior written warning or improvement plans. It's just quite the shock. \n\nBut anyway, now I find myself in the position of applying for new jobs. In this great economy, I'm pretty nervous! I do have a BS in CS and five years of full time software development experience. But how do I approach an interview when they ask why I left my previous job? \n\nAny thoughts on this situation?",

Learned a bit about neural network architecture\n* For my senior capstone project I contributed by reading signals off an arduino, made a GUI to have live signals converted into a labeled dataset, then with the help of a group member built and trained a CNN using the dataset, and finally enabled the CNN to analyze signals in real time and classify them to send a signal to another arduino. The whole project was getting emg signals off of someone‚Äôs upper arm and controlling a robotic hand at the other end of the system and I used MATLAB to do the entire data processing side.\n* I also worked for my school for two semesters. I was the TA for the analog circuits lab then for the VHDL on FPGAs class.\n\nFrom my 4 years I learned:\n\nLanguages: Python, MATLAB, R, Java, C++, VHDL, C, Assembly \n\nData: SQL, Tableau, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Sci-Kit Learn\n\nWeb: HTML/CSS\n\nI‚Äôm trying to learn Git and I‚Äôm aware of AWS but job applications are what I‚Äôve been spending most of my time on. I‚Äôm doing leetcode a few times a week but I‚Äôm burned out and just try to do it when I can. I‚Äôm also looking at making a website and doing some projects but I have little to no motivation. I have thought about grad school but it‚Äôs a financial burden on top of added stress for both me and my family.  I have reached out to family and friends and gone to my school career fair and nothing has come up yet. I‚Äôm still actively looking at non-tech companies and applying for those too and so far it‚Äôs also been silent or denial. My resume is decently formatted and I know this because it has passed through IBM and Intel ATS and actual recruiters in interviews have said, I like your formatting. I am still actively applying and have done around 80 applications so far. I plan to apply more and more daily and I‚Äôm gradually increasing my speed.\n\nSo, just like many other people I‚Äôm looking for an ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù data scientist role anywhere in Georgia. I need to stay in the state for personal reasons. No success so far but I have hope. I can hold out for another 3 months before I grab a shift at best buy or apply to revature.

His behavior seems like an attempt to look good in front of our manager and it feels out of place to me. Is this a common experience or am being overly skeptical?\n\nThis consistent behavior has raised a concern in the back of my mind. If he's emphasizing these minor contributions so prominently, what might he do in a more critical situation? I can't help but wonder if, when faced with a significant challenge or a mistake on his part, he might prioritize saving face or promoting his image over standing by his colleagues and ensuring no one is unfairly blamed.\n\nI think it's way too early to say for sure, but what do you guys think?",

        "selfText": "Recently started a new position out of college in NYC, F500 retail company (non-tech). Our team has been told we must read a number of different tech books, partially during downtime in work hours but also in free time as well. I was also told to create some programs demonstrating what I learned from these books. On top of a regular sprint workload. It is implied the team should buy a physical copy of these books, on our own dime. Ebooks/PDFs were nominally brought up as an alternative, but we routinely get chewed out for not having the physical books. \n\nIn addition, there's been some instances of oddly violent jokes being made, sometimes directed at me, sometimes at others. They're clearly jokes, but they're also things I've never heard in a corporate environment at any of my internships because it could be so easily interpreted as an actual violent threat.\n\nIn general, the attitude is one that seems to impede learning. We are highly encouraged to learn and demonstrate what we've learned *on our own* \\- but asking for help from the manager usually ends with a condescending lecture on how this is super basic and important so why don't we know this already, if we were interviewing with him now he'd rip us apart, etc. More senior members will interject with correct points only to be met with an instant \"no you're wrong\", even when they end up being right. So I've gone to other sources for help.\n\nI plan on pursuing internal opportunities (the general company culture isn't like this at all) but it'll be a while before I can do that. Until then, any suggestions on how to set the expectations right here? Or alternatively, good ways to show, like, .NET or Kafka skills which would be in those intro books? I'm not even opposed to studying on my own time, the topics I'd be studying would be pretty useful in my career, but the more worrying thing is that doing that would only open the floodgates for more work until my entire free time is consumed. There is an unlimited amount of learning I could do after all.",

[**https://thefitness.wiki/**](https://thefitness.wiki/) is the result of community discussions on best practice, expert opinion, emerging science, and general know-how from those who have made fitness their lifestyle or profession.\n\n# The r/Fitness wiki is moderator funded, and this year we are asking for your help to make it community funded.\n\nDomain registration and hosting costs over $500 per year, but it is important to us to house this resource off-platform.  Why?  To keep it ad-free and prevent any undue sponsorship or marketing influence, to keep it organized, to ensure content and links to outside resources work regardless of app or browser, to enable proper search functionality, and to make sure it's available during site outages.  **If you'd like to contribute**, you can anonymously donate any amount via [an Amazon e-gift card](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-1_US_Email-eGift-Card/dp/B004LLIKVU) to [purplespengler@gmail.com](mailto:purplespengler@gmail.com).  Donations will be closed once the hosting fees are reached, and we thank you for your consideration.\n\n# Resources - Check these for answers before posting a question!\n\n* [The r/Fitness Wiki and FAQ.](https://thefitness.wiki/)  Most questions that people come to r/Fitness with can be answered directly by the Wiki and FAQ or by applying the information found in it.  It will always be the best first place to look for answers.  Moderators or the community can help direct you to the right information if you have trouble finding it.\n* [Searching past threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/search?q=&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)  r/Fitness has over a decade of discussion threads that are very likely to have answers to your questions if our Wiki and FAQ does not.  Remember when searching that fitness and exercise are not fast moving topics, and even discussions that are several years old are going to be relevant today.\n* [Google.](https://www.google.com/)  Yes, really, or your preferred search engine.  Google excels at being a source of answers for common fitness and exercise questions including exercise alternatives or progressions, meal plan and food options, equipment or product reviews, and so on.\n* Yourself.  Many questions we see come down to a matter of personal preference or can be answered by \"it depends.\"  You should check in with yourself before asking the community to decide something for you.\n\n# The Rules\n\n[The rules for r/Fitness can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules)\n\nr/Fitness is a high traffic community that is heavily moderated to maintain quality control and make good use of the resources provided.

        "selfText": "**Background**:    \n\nI‚Äôm a 39-year-old male @ 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 173.0#\n\nI‚Äôve been lifting off and on, for the past 23+ years, and I was really BIG on muscle confusion‚Ä¶ I think I read too many damn magazines about short tricks to get six pack abs and beach ready arms. \n\nINCONSISTENT DIET LETTUCE BOY FTW. \n\nBut I did have a six pack years ago, and at some point along the way I set a lot of PR‚Äôs that I‚Äôve since had the opportunity to smash (except for one bench rep PR set back in Jan. 2014). Anyway, I was never really consistent, until March of 2020 (thanks Covid). I started back-up with some bodyweight work (thanks /u/govschwarzenegger) which left me wrecked for a few too many days. \n\nEventually made my way back to the garage w/ actual weights and did some Muscle &amp; Fitness dumbbell routines until the gyms opened back up and dove head first into 531 Forever‚Äôs SVR II. \n\nProgramming that I‚Äôve run through the years includes, but isn‚Äôt limited to: The Waterbury Method, Starting Strength (because, of course), Starr‚Äôs 5x5, 25 for Strength, every. damn. thing from T-Nation and Men‚Äôs Health‚Ä¶ those M&amp;F d-bell routines‚Ä¶ fast-forward to 531‚Äôs SVR II, BBB 3 Month Challenge, BBB, Beefcake; SBS (formerly A2S); PPSA‚Äôs Squatober, Deadcember, Let‚Äôs Pregame, Pool Season I &amp; II, Benchamin Franklin, and Brickhouse. \n\n**What is Bomb the Fitness Industry, Bro?**    \nIt‚Äôs a Frankenstein‚Äôd 531 program, written by /u/TheMightyGullet, in which you incorporate the tenants of 531‚Äôs 5‚Äôs pro, Boring But Big, AND Boring But Strong. This program is great, if you‚Äôre a volume junkie. [Here‚Äôs the direct link to TMG‚Äôs post from a few years back](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/rudoce/program_review_531_bomb_the_fitness_industry). I‚Äôd recommend reading his write-up to understand the plan fully. [There‚Äôs only one other review of the program](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/117dhtx/531_btfi_review/), by /u/hjprice14.\n\nThe *leaders* and *anchors* were set-up, as follows:\n\n*Leader*:    \n- 531 &amp; Jokers\n- 50-100 reps, accessories \n- BBB @ 50-60-70%, variation lift\n\n*Anchor*:    \n- 531\n- BBS - 10x5 @ FSL + 2.5% on 5+, 10x4 @ FSL + 5% on 3+, and 10x3 @ FSL + 10% on 1+\n- 25-50 reps, accessories\n- BBB @ 50-60-70%, variation lift\n\n**Things I liked**:    \nI‚Äôd never done the 50+ accessory reps during the leader; they‚Äôre often, as you know, left for the anchor. TMG was right in-that you‚Äôre burnt out once you hit the anchor, and more often than not, I was also dropping the accessory work (especially towards the final week or so, if not sooner). This was a fun twist on the typical 531 accessory work. \n\n**Things I changed/Did differently**:    \nI messed up my right knee doing front squats, and as a result had a difficult time walking for several weeks, in late-April. So, I needed something that I could do a whole bunch of ‚Äúbro‚Äù work for 4-6 days a week. I lift at home, early, so it‚Äôs not an issue to get out to the pole barn for me. I thought to myself, ‚Äúbro‚Äôs don‚Äôt squat, so I guess I‚Äôm a ‚Äòbro.‚Äù I pulled all squats from the program, and only added deadlifts after the first three week cycle. My goal here was to set two new pressing PR‚Äôs, in bench and strict/military press. Once I was able to start deadlift again, I just wanted to pull 315#, for a PR. \n\nI did no joker work, here. More often than not, I was trying to get in-and-out (are those burgers really that good?). Also, I wanted to hold back on the ego lifting, which has gotten the better of me, through the years. \n\nTo add some extra ‚Äúfun‚Äù into the program, I also took a tenet from BBB‚Äôs 3 Month Challenge, in which you increase the % of the BBB supplemental work each week from 50&gt;60&gt;70. I am not a smart man. Would I do this again? Absolutely. \n\nI also added in my own thing, because TRAINING ADHD! I began doing ‚Äú100 Days of Summer‚Äù to grow my arms (I blame you, Starting Strength from *checks calendar* 200‚Ä¶ okay, that‚Äôs a decade-plus‚Ä¶). Each day, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, I did 100 reps of bi‚Äôs and tri‚Äôs. No write-up on that one, as I wasn‚Äôt consistent enough, and didn‚Äôt do proper documentation on it. I‚Äôll try it again next summer. \n\nI‚Äôm also a big fan of the 351 set-up, versus the 531 set-up. It‚Äôs personal preference, and more than likely won‚Äôt impact/affect performance. \n\n*My general week looked like this*:    \nD1 \n- Deads 351 @ 5‚Äôs PRO\n- CG Bench BBB 5x10 @ 50/60/70%\n\nD2\n- Bench 351 @ 5‚Äôs PRO\n- Press BBS 10x5 @ FSL\n\nD3\n- Deads BBS \n- Seated Press BBB 5x10 @ 50/60/70\n\nD4\n- Press 351 @ 5‚Äôs PRO\n- Deficit Deads BBB 5x10 @ 50/60/70%\n\nD5\n- Bench BBS 10x5 @ FSL\n\n**What worked?**    \nPressing volume. Turn the speaker up to 11, and press. My shoulders, chest, and tri‚Äôs BLEW UP during this run, all without injury/issue. \n\nMy body responds well to volume. But‚Ä¶ no sets went to 11. \n\nI ate at maintenance. I didn‚Äôt want to get above 170# until Labor Day weekend (which is the official start of bulk szn for me). Breakfast was more often than not 4-6 eggs, 2 slices of toast, large bowl of oatmeal w/ pb and jelly, and a banana/fruit. Lunch was dinner leftovers, and dinner was generally meat and carbs w/ some fat (I have an issue getting enough fat into my diet). Really, by the 4th of July I was holding steady over 170#. I ultimately went from 166# &gt; 173#.\n\n**What didn‚Äôt work?**    \nDoing 100 lats and abs every workout, on top of the 50+ accessory reps, and all the 531/BBB/BBS work. It just didn‚Äôt happen. \n\nThe other issue I ran into was conditioning. Not being able to walk also meant no running. Which also meant rowing was pretty tough. I‚Äôm not quite sure when my knee finally healed, but safe to say my only conditioning during this program was to lift weights faster. See, it‚Äôs not just a meme, it‚Äôs a whey of life. \n\n**Well, let‚Äôs see it!**    \nOkay, calm down you little minx. \n\n[Here‚Äôs my failed bench PR attempt @ 200#](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cv-AurztJkw/). As one member said, I probably had too many warm-up sets going into the top set. But, I‚Äôd just tied my 195# PR. 200# is there, just need to be smarter about the approach, next time.\n\n[Here‚Äôs my deadlift PR @ 335#](https://www.instagram.com/p/CwAvflqJzpK/). So long, 315#. \n\n[Here‚Äôs my press PR @ 145#](https://www.instagram.com/p/CwFcw48pzOf/). And yes, there are dogs in the video. \n\nYou‚Äôve scrolled this far, so here‚Äôs a [vanity pic](https://www.instagram.com/p/Csvnyr7OA0s/) I‚Äôd taken when I started 100 Days of Summer. I don‚Äôt have a post-BTFIB pic. Sorry. \n\n*Weight* - 166 &gt; 173\n\n*All-time PR‚Äôs*\n\n**Bench** - 195 &gt; 195\n\n**Deadlift** - 310 &gt; 335\n\n**Press**- 135 &gt; 145\n\n**What‚Äôs next?**    \nCurrently running Squatober for the 3rd straight year. Then, I‚Äôll run PPSA‚Äôs ‚ÄúBenchamin Franklin‚Äù w/ deads added (the program doesn‚Äôt include deadlifts), hence the name: Benchamin Franklin is Dead, or BFD. Then, it‚Äôs Deadcember, and FINALLY, I‚Äôll run BTM in January.",

        "user": "MythicalStrength",
        "score": 91,
        "selfText": "Howdy redditors,\n\nI‚Äôve competed in another strongman competition, this time my first time as a Lightweight Male in the 181lb class.  I‚Äôll cut to the chase and say I came in dead last and zero‚Äôd more events than I‚Äôd ever done before.  I‚Äôve dropped 35lbs since March, and I‚Äôm still adjusting to my new body in that regard, which helped make this one of the most challenging competitions of my life.  I‚Äôm pretty excited in that regard, and thought I‚Äôd share the experience.\n\nIf you want to read about the training/nutrition leading up to it, check [here](http://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/)\n\nAnd for video of the full comp, check [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hM4rfc9xAD8)\n\n**PRE-COMP**\n\nI ate the same breakfast I‚Äôve been having every training day: 150g of egg whites mixed with 150g of beef bone broth with 1.5 scoops of Metabolic Drive and some powdered electrolytes.  A wild departure from my days of eating‚Ä¶nothing, so I could make weight, followed by some sort of sugary/fast food blitz.  I drove an uneventful 2.25 hours to the site and weighed in at 173.0 while wearing full sweats, shoes, and my strongman compression gear underneath.  \n\nI set-up camp and actually dug into one of my meals before the first event: 4 hardboiled whole pasture raised organic eggs mashed into a paste with a serving of grassfed sour cream and 4oz (cooked) of ground venison, personally hunted and butchered by my wife‚Äôs Uncle.  Another departure from my glory days, which I‚Äôll address next, but it was also weird being so hungry when I hadn‚Äôt done anything yet.  \n\n**GOALS**\n\nSince I knew I was super behind the 8-ball on this due to my bodyweight, this was going to be a different kind of comp for me: this was about personal growth.  My goals were to not eat any junk OR carbs and keep it as carnivore as possible.  Not because I felt like this was more noble, but more to simply see if I could, and how it would go.  The Metabolic Drive was the closest ‚Äúexception‚Äù and I packed an emergency Finibar in case I found myself crashing, but otherwise it was just going to be that mashed egg/venison mixture, green tea and water.  \n\nI also was going to go limited caffeine: only the stuff in the green tea.  I have a 3 week streak without energy drinks of coffee going, and I wanna see how long I can keep it going.  Again: no particular reason, just to see if I could.  In the past, I‚Äôd be about 2-3 energy drinks deep by the end of the day.  Did I ‚Äúneed‚Äù that?\n\nThe third goal was to not re-tear whatever it was I tore in my right knee on week 2 of ‚ÄúJuggeryoke‚Äù.  The first event was where I was most worried about that, since I did it on the log, but I was going to keep my eye on it all competition.\n\nAnd final goal was to leave it all out there and have fun.  It‚Äôs the whole reason I signed up.\n\n**EVENT 1: 200lb Log Clean and Press Each Rep**\n\nI was excited about this event, since cleaning each rep is awesome and gasses competitors.  Then I got to actually handle the log we were going to use and realized this was going to be a ‚Äú WHO can get a rep‚Äù contest for the lightweights.  The log handles were STUPID far apart, like the Rogue 10‚Äù.  \n\nFirst guy got the clean but no rep.  Second guy got in 2 of the grandest reps of all time with a jerk and a JPS-esque ‚Äúpress the log off the head‚Äù technique. \n\nI got set, got my head right, grabbed the log, went to clean it, felt it feel like a jillion pounds, got stuck midway, somehow through sheer force of will get it all the way to my chest‚Ä¶and knew that there was absolutely no way I was going to press it.  I let it crash, thinking that, if I could do better on another clean and not be so exhausted, I might be able to set up for a stronger press.  Well, that didn‚Äôt happen, and I didn‚Äôt want to re-tear my left bicep on an errant log clean, so after a few more attempts, I hung it up.  The guy after me got a jillion reps and was the clear candidate for first that day.\n\n**EVENT 2: Max Trap Bar in 3 attempts**\n\nI had been doing a ROM progression cycle on trap bar with 405lbs, so I knew I was good for that.  We were allowed to pick the starting weight in the rules meeting, so I asked for 400, knowing we‚Äôd go 20lb jumps from there.\n\nThe guy who also zero‚Äôd the log ended up asking for us to start with 380, and he missed that, so I knew if I got 400 I at least had a win there.  400 was grindy, but made it.  We were apparently pulling on the Eleiko Oppen bar, which was cool since it had knurl marks on the center of the handle, which made strapping in easy.  I had an issue with strapping in too far forward or backward in training and having the bar tilt.\n\nNo other MLWs went for 400, the next time one jumped in was at 460, so I went for that to match too.  460 felt WAY too damn heavy, but I pulled it.  Since we were doing ‚ÄúRising Bar‚Äù, I decided to pass on 480 to allow me some recovery time, and asked for 500.  I really liked Rising bar for the strategic element of it, and it made a last man standing event tolerable.  I actually felt 500 ever so slightly start to break off the floor, but not enough to be worth chasing after.  My knee was holding up strong so far, and this was keeping it in place.\n\n**EVENT 3: Sandbag and sled drag**\n\nThis and the 4th event are why I signed up: medleys in a competition.  I missed these so much.  Unlike previous comps, I did ZERO sandbag training to prep for this, which was for the best, because I usually end up tearing the hell out of my arms when I do that.  \n\nI used some strongman cheating and put the sandbag on top of my feet as part of my set-up.  This gives a little bit of daylight between the floor and the bag, which allows for handholds.  I also ditched my competition shirt at this point and decided I was going to go for the Mariusz Pudzianowski/Jon Andersen Award for ‚ÄúMost Jacked Person at the Competition‚Äù, because if  can‚Äôt be the strongest at least I can look pretty while I lose.  You can actually hear some folks making commentary about it during this event.\n\nThe sandbag pick actually went pretty well, and the carry moved about as fast as I would expect with so minimal training.  The sled drag caught me off guard: about the only clue it was going to be so awful was watching the other competitors attempting the sled and being caught off guard.  So I went for the initial pull, realized it was going to be heavy as hell, and just leaned into it and pulled like hell, knowing that, if I ever stopped, I‚Äôd be dead.  Just like a shark.\n\nI was surprised when I ran out of time.  I felt like I was moving at a good pace.  I had a slight technical error getting set up on the straps, and I lost a little bit of time on the bag, but ultimately I imagine I needed to move faster on the sled.\n\nBut I think this was the first time I had a sled in a comp where I didn‚Äôt fall backwards on my butt, so that‚Äôs a win.  This got me a last place finish.\n\n**EVENT 4: Duckwalk and powerstairs**\n\nEvent was supposed to be duck walk 25‚Äô, do 3 reps of power stairs, then duckwalk it back.\n\nLotta dudes were struggling with those stairs, and I figured out where: those WIDE 100lb plates pretty much give you no opportunity to hinge.  I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô9, so I‚Äôm already sawed off as it is, but now that I have to take a sumo stance I was totally hosed.  \n\nBut also, you might be able to tell in the video: I about blacked out on the initial pick, and was basically jump zombie-ing forward until I went night-night.  I managed to fall forward, have the stars clear, do a quick pick and repeat.  I fell into the platform, corrected myself, and struggled futilely to get it to the platform.  But I gave it some solid effort, and loading my frame down with 100lbs over bodyweight was awesome for making every muscle in my body pop, so I got a cool facebook photo.  This, once again, got me last place.\n\n**EVENT 5: Stone Medley**\n\nI won‚Äôt bother listing weights and heights here, because as you saw on the video, it was a big goose egg.  This is the only event I have a bitter taste in my mouth about.  You might be able to see it in the video, but I was literally GLUED to the stone.  I applied a moderate amount of tack to myself, but the stone ITSELF was COATED in tacky from previous competitors, to the point that it was stuck to the platform.  So it didn‚Äôt matter about being strong enough to pick up the stone: I had to be strong enough to BREAK the tacky off the stone first and THEN pick it up, and then, once I got it lapped, it wasn‚Äôt going anywhere else.  With how high the platform was, my plan was to try to shoulder it, but I could never even get the momentum necessary, because it was like trying to walk through mud: each movement was about getting unstuck and then stuck again.\n\nI realized at that point I‚Äôm a dinosaur in the sport: everyone else is using tacky shirts and stone sleeves and, in turn, has material that can help by pass the tacky issue, while I‚Äôm just applying sticky stuff to my body.  I the future, I think I‚Äôm just going to avoid tackying myself and just rely on what‚Äôs on the stone.  Zero‚Äôd here.\n\nI will say that I got another great strongman win here: as I was standing there, bare chested and covered in tacky, another dude who was going that route was standing next to me.  He was definitely more ‚Äústrongman built‚Äù.  He looked at me, there was a pause, and then he ‚ÄúDude..are you, like, bodybuilding?‚Äù\n\nI replied with ‚ÄúNope: just not eating enough‚Äù.\n\nHe appreciated that.  Told me I was definitely the leanest dude there, and I said ‚ÄúWell at least I won that‚Äù. \n\n**LESSONS LEARNED**\n\nI knew coming in this light was going to be a challenge, and it delivered.  Doing no specific training for the comp also added to that.  But, that‚Äôs really the big thing: I grew up.  Strongman isn‚Äôt my life anymore: it‚Äôs a thing I do for fun.  And that‚Äôs absolutely what happened: I had a blast and I DIDN‚ÄôT have to change my life for it.  I kept training the week of the comp, went for a 3 mile walk with my family after it was done (and after having an AMAZING dinner at our favorite BBQ place where I got the biggest, fattest pork ribs I‚Äôd ever seen in my life alongside some amazing sliced brisket) and just treated this like it was an events day.  I intend to keep it this way: if a comp looks fun, I‚Äôll sign up and have a blast.  And I got to help out some folks along the way: the guy who took second in my weight class cramped up BAD, so I gave him some of the electrolytes I brought and it totally transformed him.  I also let him use some of the goo gone and paper towels I brought for tacky removal and got him sold of WD-40.  And I got to meet a few awesome folks off reddit as well.  A dude named John (went by u/ifrankthepug back in the day) introduced himself to me: ‚ÄúDude, are you MythicalStrength?  I‚Äôve been reading your articles for 6 years!‚Äù  That was really cool, and honestly was one of the highlights of the competition.\n\nGot to meet up with u/eric_twinge as well.  Was awesome getting to put a face to the name.\n\n**WHAT‚ÄôS NEXT**\n\nWell, about that: I originally had a competition signed up for 14 Oct‚Ä¶but I just went looking for it and it‚Äôs gone: instead, having been moved to 4 Nov.  That‚Äôs a less viable date for me, and currently I‚Äôm the only person in the 181 weight class, so there‚Äôs very little incentive to go do it compared to just a hard events day at home.  I have a 5k signed up for 15 Oct, and then I go for a Disney Cruise on 16 Oct.  So now that I don‚Äôt have a competition looming, I‚Äôm probably going to do 2 more weeks of Juggeryoke with a few movement alterations leading up to the cruise and most likely do a mini-famine there so that I can absolutely eat my face off the whole time I‚Äôm cruising.  After that?  Chaos is the Plan.  But I‚Äôll be at this weight class for the next competition, whenever that happens.",
