        "selfText": "# Hello fellow programs!\n\n**tl;dr what should r/programming's rules be?** And also a call for additional mods. We'll leave this stickied for a few days to gather feedback.\n\nHere are the broad categories of content that we see, along with whether they are **currently** allowed. ‚úÖ means that it's currently allowed, üö´ means that it's not currently allowed, ‚ö†Ô∏è means that we leave it up if it is already popular but if we catch it young in its life we do try to remove it early.\n\n* ‚úÖ Actual programming content. They probably have actual code in them. Language or library writeups, papers, technology descriptions. How an allocator works. How my new fancy allocator I just wrote works. How our startup built our Frobnicator, rocket ship emoji. For many years this was the only category of allowed content.\n* ‚úÖ Programming news. ChatGPT can write code. A big new CVE just dropped. Curl 8.01 released now with Coffee over IP support.\n* ‚úÖ Programmer career content. How to become a Staff engineer in 30 days. Habits of the best engineering managers. How to deal with your annoying coworkers, *Jeff*.\n* ‚úÖ Articles/news interesting *to* programmers but not about programming. Work from home is bullshit. Return to office is bullshit. There's a Steam sale on programming games. Terry Davis has died. How to SCRUMM. App Store commissions are going up. How to hire a more diverse development team. Interviewing programmers is broken.\n* ‚ö†Ô∏è General technology news. Google buys its last competitor. A self driving car hit a pedestrian. Twitter is collapsing. Oculus accidentally showed your grandmother a penis. Github sued when Copilot produces the complete works of Harry Potter in a code comment. Meta cancels work from home. Gnome dropped a feature I like. How to run Stable Diffusion to generate pictures of, uh, cats, yeah it's definitely just for cats. A bitcoin VR metaversed my AI and now my app store is mobile social local.\n* üö´ Politics. The Pirate Party is winning in Sweden. Please vote for net neutrality. Big Tech is being sued in Europe for *gestures broadly*.\n* üö´ Gossip. Richard Stallman switches to Windows. Elon Musk farted. Linus Torvalds was a poopy-head on a mailing list. Grace Hopper Conference is now 60% male. The People's Rust Foundation is arguing with the Rust Foundation For The People. Terraform has been forked into Terra and Form. Stack Overflow sucks now. Stack Overflow is good actually.\n* ‚úÖ Demos with code. I wrote a game, here it is on GitHub\n* üö´ Demos without code. I wrote a game, come buy it! Please give me feedback on my startup (totally not an ad nosirree). I stayed up all night writing a commercial text editor, here's the pricing page. I made a DALL-E image generator. I made the fifteenth animation of A* this week, here's a GIF.\n* üö´ AskReddit type forum questions. What's your favourite programming language? Tabs or spaces? Does anyone else hate it when.\n* üö´ Support questions. How do I write a web crawler? How do I get into programming? Where's my missing semicolon? Please do this obvious homework problem for me. Personally I feel very strongly about not allowing these because they'd quickly drown out all of the actual content I come to see, and there are already much more effective places to get them answered anyway. In real life the quality of the ones that we see is also universally very low.\n* üö´ Surveys and üö´ Job postings and anything else that is looking to extract value from a place a lot of programmers hang out without contributing anything itself.\n* üö´ Meta posts. DAE think r/programming sucks? Why did you remove my post? Why did you ban this user that is totes not me I swear I'm just asking questions. Except this meta post. This one is okay because I'm a tyrant that the rules don't apply to (I assume you are saying about me to yourself right now).\n* üö´ Images, memes, anything low-effort or low-content. Thankfully we very rarely see any of this so there's not much to remove but like support questions once you have a few of these they tend to totally take over because it's easier to make a meme than to write a paper and also easier to vote on a meme than to read a paper.\n* ‚ö†Ô∏è Posts that we'd normally allow but that are obviously, unquestioningly super low quality like blogspam copy-pasted onto a site with a bazillion ads. It has to be pretty bad before we remove it and even then sometimes these are the first post to get traction about a news event so we leave them up if they're the best discussion going on about the news event. There's a lot of grey area here with CVE announcements in particular: there are a lot of spammy security \"blogs\" that syndicate stories like this.\n* ‚ö†Ô∏è Posts that are duplicates of other posts or the same news event. We leave up either the first one or the healthiest discussion.\n* ‚ö†Ô∏è Posts where the title editorialises too heavily or especially is a lie or conspiracy theory.\n* Comments are only very loosely moderated and it's mostly üö´ Bots of any kind (Beep boop you misspelled misspelled!) and üö´ Incivility (You idiot, everybody knows that my favourite toy is better than your favourite toy.) However the number of obvious GPT comment bots is rising and will quickly become untenable for the number of active moderators we have.\n\nThere are some topics such as Code of Conduct arguments within projects that I don't know where to place where we've been doing a civility check on the comments thread and using that to make the decision. Similarly some straddle the line (a link to a StackOverflow post asking for help and the reddit OP is the StackOverflow OP, but there's a lot of technical content and the reddit discussion is healthy). And even most üö´s above are left up if there's a healthy discussion going already by the time we see it.\n\n# So what now?\n\nWe need to decide **what r/programming should be about** and we need to write those rules down so that mods can consistently apply them. The rules as written are pretty vague and the way we're moderating in practise is only loosely connected to them. We're looking for feedback on what kind of place r/programming should be so tell us below.\n\n**We need additional mods**. If you're interested in helping moderate **please post below, saying why you'd be a good mod and what you'd would change about the space if you were**. You don't need to be a moderator elsewhere but please do mention it if you are and what we could learn on r/programming that you already know. Currently I think I'm the only one going down the new page every morning and removing the rule-breaking posts. (Today these are mostly \"how do I program computer\" or \"can somebody help me fix my printer\", and obvious spam.) This results in a lot of threads complaining about the moderation quality and, well, it's not wrong. I'm not rigorously watching the mod queue and I'm not trawling comments threads looking for bad actors unless I'm in that thread anyway and I don't use reddit every single day. So if we want it to be better we'll need more human power.\n\n# FAQ: Why do we need moderation at all? Can't the votes just do it?\n\nWe know there is demand for unmoderated spaces in the world, but r/programming isn't that space. This is our theory on why keeping the subreddit on topic is important:\n\n* Forums have the interesting property that **whatever is on the front page today is what will be on the front page tomorrow**. When a user comes to the site and sees a set of content, they believe that that's what this website is about. If they like it they'll stay and contribute that kind of content and if they don't like it they won't stay, leaving only the people that liked the content they saw yesterday. So the seed content is important and keeping things on topic is important. If you like r/programming then you need moderation to keep it the way that you like it (or make it be the place you wish it were) because otherwise entropic drift will make it be a different place. And once you have moderation it's going to have a subjective component, that's just the nature of it.\n* Because of the way reddit works, on a light news day r/programming doesn't get enough daily content for articles to meaningfully compete with each other. Towards the end of the day if I post something to r/programming it will immediately go to the front page of all r/programming subscribers. So while it's true that sub-par and rule-breaking posts already do most of their damage before the mods even see them, the whole theory of posts competing via votes alone doesn't really work in a lower-volume subreddit.\n* Because of the mechanics of moderation it's not really possible to allow the subreddit to be say 5% support questions. Even if we wanted to allow it to be a small amount of the conten, the individuals whose content was removed would experience and perceive this as a punitive action against them. That means that any category we allow could theoretically completely take over r/programming (like the career posts from last week) so we should only allow types of content that we'd be okay with taking it over.\n\nPersonally my dream is for r/programming to be the place with the highest quality programming content, where I can go to read something interesting and learn something new every day. That dream is at odds with allowing every piece of blogspam and \"10 ways to convince your boss to give you a raise, #2 will get you fired!\"",

At least not today .... like all i had to do was a simple npm install and npm run dev but it won't work. ok! \n\nI also have this crippling fear of tampering with the master branch somehow and fucking up their repo which is not allowing me to dig deeper into why it's not working on my end\n\nBut anyways. i'll fix it tomorrow hopefully \n\nI'm looking at this repo right now which is part of a brand that is so popular in my country that when they told me they worked on its website i couldn't even believe it\n\nit's a huge project. For context: the biggest project i worked on by myself for my personal portfolio had at max 30 folders to explore. This one has 400. \n\nIt's a Next.js project which is the framework i liked the most while coding my own projects but even then i'm finding it really hard to walk through it cause i'm so overwhelmed by everything. Idk but I'm praying it gets better. AND FAST. \n\nRemote working is fun but i can't bring myself to ask for help to any of my coworkers as it seems they are always in a video conference and i don't want to bother, unless they're the ones to call me first.\n\nit doesn't really feel like i'm doing anything though? Like nothing has really changed from when i would just spend entire days watching youtube tutorials while programming in my room. Not even the location has changed. The only thing that has changed is the fact that i'm def more anxious maybe\n\nAnyways, if you read up until here, first of all sorry for wasting your time second of all i have some questions:\n\nDid all this happen to you as well? When did you start feeling like you were Truly learning and getting better at programming during an internship? \n\nDid you ever feel like a fraud who doesn't even know how to use a computer anymore in the beginning too?\n\nOr am i not built for this and should go work at the local mcdonals instead (which is a cool work environment but too noisy for me personally)?\n\nWhy am i not a professional web developer after having completed 5 days of internship?\n\ndumb jokes aside.. thanks for reading, i appreciate any comments and have a great day :)",

(Thought about Fontys Uni of applied sciences (ICT &amp; Software engineering) but after some reviews I don't think so (it's weak I guess). Also probably will need to take extra English exam - IELTS - to get into Uni abroad.  \nPlease if anyone can give some advices in which country it's better to study or which University to try to apply I would really appreciate it. Anything would help.",

        "selfText": "Im currently creating a Oath Server and Frontend Application. My current setup does as follow:  \n\n\nNextJS (+NextAuth) starts a login -&gt; The user gets redirected to the login page -&gt; After authorization the authorization code is caught by next.js on the server side and an access token is requested via server side code. Now i need to store that access token somewhere secure. To me there are 2 potential possibilites right now:  \n\n\n1. Store it in a http-only (secure) cookie JWT (with encrypted content possibly). That way it is not accessable through JavaScript, and potential XSS cannot steal the auth code.\n2. Store it in a database, give the client only a (http only and secure) session cookie, on request of a resource, lookup the access token in the database and then send the request from the server side with the token and forward the result (That way the access token never reaches the client). - This is recommended by the RFC afaik.\n\nHowever number 2 introduces somewhat of complexity with an additional database and latency (altough encryption in cookies also introduces some latency). The pro side is that the access token can never be grabbed by the client (even in case of an xss). However through security vulnerabilities, the cookie in both cases might be stolen, so in both cases the attacker can make a request on behalf of the user by using the cookie against the server (which will then call the resource server). So i do not really see a benefit of using the database setup compared to the encrypted cookie (Altough if the cookie can somehow be decrypted the access token could be used elsewhere). Which of those options would you generally consider a \"best practice\" in terms of security? Is it still better for security to use the database setup, or this it just introduce unnecessary complexity? Is there another option which would be even better?",

        "selfText": "**Some background before the background:** Alex Bromeley had released the concept of this program approximately 9 months ago, and released the full template for free, on his YouTube channel, alongside an e-book for purchase. I will disclose: I had purchased the book, as I generally enjoy his content overall and wanted to continue to support his work. You can find his videos here:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj3Mq91hZEQ&amp;t=129s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj3Mq91hZEQ&amp;t=129s) \\-first video, discusses the ideologies, and thought process behind the program.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuRM2EkMctU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuRM2EkMctU) \\- video two, the actual program with sets and reps laid out.\n\n**Training history and back ground:**\n\nI (M31, 5'11) started lifting around college. The term \"lifting\" could probably be used loosely as I had no idea what I was doing in the early days. At that time I had a woman I was dating write me a very simple exercise program, just to get myself in the gym and to be more active, as I was mostly sedentary well into my 20's. Following that time of my life, I got very much into pursuing more strength , over aesthetics, and that lead me to programs that aligned with more of that desire, some programs of honorable mention have been basic 5x5 progressions, a brief stint with 5/3/1 and its variants, Juggernaut and a highly bastardized version of conjugate leading into those dark times of covid shut down back in 2020.\n\nFollowing the return the gym after nearly a full year hiatus, I got highly focused on the pursuit of strength numbers again. In the middle of 2022 I hit a major stall in progress with an approximately 220lb bench, 430lb deadlift, 350 lb. squat and a 135 lb. OHP. That stall lead me to hiring a coach, as well as seeking more information on my own, and after a year I had broken through the plateau as well as lost some body fat, but nothing that warranted keeping that coach further. So I moved on in approximately May of 2023. However this lead to my dilemma of figuring out what my next steps would be.\n\nI was feeling pretty banged up from all the strength work/low reps, and my joint were begging for mercy, I definitely felt another stall on the horizon, and knew I needed to change up my approach if I wanted to continue to make something happen. At the time I had read base strength and peak strength and knew I wanted to follow something to that effect, but also knew I needed a longer reprieve in the base building territory, and needed more time away from the basic lifts I'd been grinding for almost a year. So I opted to follow Kong.\n\n**The Program:**\n\nTo sum up in a very short and condensed package, Kong is a 12 week program that is broken up into three blocks that follow a week to week progression scheme based on ascending RPE, and small tweaks in reps and sets. This also follows his pretty standard approach to volumizing as well often with sets being added the deeper into the blocks you get. Its a five day per week program, breaking up the body in different ways block to block. I could outline it here further for you, but if this sounds like your interest I'd just watch the video, after all these folks are more articulate than me anyway.\n\n**Diet**:\n\nI was tracking food an eating in a slight surplus i was shooting on average 250-400 calories above maintenance, and I typically opt for more carbs in general- I felt really good going into my evening work out times, and was definitely well fed. I am not a nutritionist I will not advise what you should do.\n\nResults:\n\nGiven that the goal of the program is mass, and not strength numbers I will share I thought this was very successful for me I had started the program weighing in at 205lbs on average and ended with an average of around 212lbs, I will apologize I did not take progress pictures, as I was not planning on writing a review at the time. Areas that I personally grew: my shoulders REALLY blocked out and widened as did my lats, my triceps also got some additional growth that was noticeable from other reports. My quads also grew enough I needed to buy some new pants, so there is that...\n\n**Some thoughts for each block, and then overall thoughts and :**\n\nBlock 1: This block was the hardest for me personally, this is also where the exercise selection feels the most broad. Reps are typically in the 15-20 rep range on week one, and taper down to sets of 10 and 12 at RPE 10. There were a lot of movements I was either very inexperienced in or very unfamiliar with i.e. JM presses and behind the neck presses to name a couple. I was also very unfamiliar with gauging RPE at this point, and throughout the program RPE never quite made sense logically in my head, so I was overreaching a lot in the RPE department, this will become a theme for each block ESPECIALLY on the leg days.\n\nBlock 2: This is where I think I personally hit my stride with the program as it was primarily movements I have done a lot of work with and had good ball park numbers to go off of. In this block it is a lot of disadvantaged movements, followed by similar movement pattern exercises and additional accessories in a pyramid fashion, still utilizing RPE as the primary metric. RPE was starting to click on upper body days really well, and I was pretty frequently on target , or just a slight undershoot, but always left feeling pretty solid. Lower body days were still hell and proceeded to give me a lot of grief. I was not being accustomed to the level of volume specifically around knee flexion due to a lot of squatting, leg extensions, and single leg exercises. My left knee started to become very irritated, with the familiar sting of tendonitis. This is also where I screwed up, instead of letting of the gas, and correcting my volume leading into block three, I maintained course and speed annnnnd that was a big big mistake on my end.\n\nBlock 3:\n\nWe now switch from disadvantaged movements, to very much overloaded types of movement, for top sets followed by back off work and I will say,,, bromely said in the book to let it fly, and I took that statement as a personal challenge. Some fun accomplishments was a push press at 185 for a top triple, a wide grip bench in which I three RM'd my old 1 rep max (240lbs), and a quite lovely 13inch deadlift that was 465 for 5. You will notice you will not see a squat here, that is because due to the patellar tendonitis issues and some degree of compensation for that, my hips and IT band decided to ignite on fire, resulting in some of the most painful lateral knee pain I have ever experienced , and continues to be an issue for me right now as I write this. This is most likely due to weeks and weeks of misgauging rpe and not knowing just how much effort I was putting into some of these work outs.\n\nOverall :\n\ndespite injury during this program was a lot of fun to run, it had so much variety , and so much new movement that it felt like I was in newbie gains all over again! The volume feels manageable when you factor in eating and getting adequate rest. I think that if you have committed to strength for a long time, like I have this can be a nice and refreshing change of pace. I am currently finding it carrying over very nicely now that I am running bullmastiff at the current moment. I was very pleased with my results and continue to be pleased.\n\nSome things I would have done differently, I would have probably wanted to touch some of the exercises that I have never done before for some top sets, prior to running the program to have a general idea of what weight I could handle. In the last few months I have come across, MIke Tuchscherer's RPE chart, and would probably want to use that as general tool to \"be in the ball park\" for weight selection, as I was generally basing most of my weigh choices of of variations that I did know. I think this is also what lead to me frequently over shooting my RPE.\n\nOverall, I will run it again in the future, my intention will be to run it when/if I feel I need a more prolonged base phase and when I think I need more time to broaden out and get more variety.\n\nIf you have any more specific questions I would love to answer them! But I would strongly recommend his material on the program!",

[Here‚Äôs the direct link to TMG‚Äôs post from a few years back](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/rudoce/program_review_531_bomb_the_fitness_industry). I‚Äôd recommend reading his write-up to understand the plan fully. [There‚Äôs only one other review of the program](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/117dhtx/531_btfi_review/), by /u/hjprice14.\n\nThe *leaders* and *anchors* were set-up, as follows:\n\n*Leader*:    \n- 531 &amp; Jokers\n- 50-100 reps, accessories \n- BBB @ 50-60-70%, variation lift\n\n*Anchor*:    \n- 531\n- BBS - 10x5 @ FSL + 2.5% on 5+, 10x4 @ FSL + 5% on 3+, and 10x3 @ FSL + 10% on 1+\n- 25-50 reps, accessories\n- BBB @ 50-60-70%, variation lift\n\n**Things I liked**:    \nI‚Äôd never done the 50+ accessory reps during the leader; they‚Äôre often, as you know, left for the anchor. TMG was right in-that you‚Äôre burnt out once you hit the anchor, and more often than not, I was also dropping the accessory work (especially towards the final week or so, if not sooner). This was a fun twist on the typical 531 accessory work. \n\n**Things I changed/Did differently**:    \nI messed up my right knee doing front squats, and as a result had a difficult time walking for several weeks, in late-April. So, I needed something that I could do a whole bunch of ‚Äúbro‚Äù work for 4-6 days a week. I lift at home, early, so it‚Äôs not an issue to get out to the pole barn for me. I thought to myself, ‚Äúbro‚Äôs don‚Äôt squat, so I guess I‚Äôm a ‚Äòbro.‚Äù I pulled all squats from the program, and only added deadlifts after the first three week cycle. My goal here was to set two new pressing PR‚Äôs, in bench and strict/military press. Once I was able to start deadlift again, I just wanted to pull 315#, for a PR. \n\nI did no joker work, here. More often than not, I was trying to get in-and-out (are those burgers really that good?). Also, I wanted to hold back on the ego lifting, which has gotten the better of me, through the years. \n\nTo add some extra ‚Äúfun‚Äù into the program, I also took a tenet from BBB‚Äôs 3 Month Challenge, in which you increase the % of the BBB supplemental work each week from 50&gt;60&gt;70. I am not a smart man. Would I do this again? Absolutely. \n\nI also added in my own thing, because TRAINING ADHD! I began doing ‚Äú100 Days of Summer‚Äù to grow my arms (I blame you, Starting Strength from *checks calendar* 200‚Ä¶ okay, that‚Äôs a decade-plus‚Ä¶). Each day, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, I did 100 reps of bi‚Äôs and tri‚Äôs. No write-up on that one, as I wasn‚Äôt consistent enough, and didn‚Äôt do proper documentation on it. I‚Äôll try it again next summer. \n\nI‚Äôm also a big fan of the 351 set-up, versus the 531 set-up. It‚Äôs personal preference, and more than likely won‚Äôt impact/affect performance. \n\n*My general week looked like this*:    \nD1 \n- Deads 351 @ 5‚Äôs PRO\n- CG Bench BBB 5x10 @ 50/60/70%\n\nD2\n- Bench 351 @ 5‚Äôs PRO\n- Press BBS 10x5 @ FSL\n\nD3\n- Deads BBS \n- Seated Press BBB 5x10 @ 50/60/70\n\nD4\n- Press 351 @ 5‚Äôs PRO\n- Deficit Deads BBB 5x10 @ 50/60/70%\n\nD5\n- Bench BBS 10x5 @ FSL\n\n**What worked?**    \nPressing volume. Turn the speaker up to 11, and press. My shoulders, chest, and tri‚Äôs BLEW UP during this run, all without injury/issue. \n\nMy body responds well to volume. But‚Ä¶ no sets went to 11. \n\nI ate at maintenance. I didn‚Äôt want to get above 170# until Labor Day weekend (which is the official start of bulk szn for me). Breakfast was more often than not 4-6 eggs, 2 slices of toast, large bowl of oatmeal w/ pb and jelly, and a banana/fruit. Lunch was dinner leftovers, and dinner was generally meat and carbs w/ some fat (I have an issue getting enough fat into my diet). Really, by the 4th of July I was holding steady over 170#. I ultimately went from 166# &gt; 173#.\n\n**What didn‚Äôt work?**    \nDoing 100 lats and abs every workout, on top of the 50+ accessory reps, and all the 531/BBB/BBS work. It just didn‚Äôt happen. \n\nThe other issue I ran into was conditioning. Not being able to walk also meant no running. Which also meant rowing was pretty tough. I‚Äôm not quite sure when my knee finally healed, but safe to say my only conditioning during this program was to lift weights faster. See, it‚Äôs not just a meme, it‚Äôs a whey of life. \n\n**Well, let‚Äôs see it!**    \nOkay, calm down you little minx. \n\n[Here‚Äôs my failed bench PR attempt @ 200#](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cv-AurztJkw/). As one member said, I probably had too many warm-up sets going into the top set. But, I‚Äôd just tied my 195# PR. 200# is there, just need to be smarter about the approach, next time.\n\n[Here‚Äôs my deadlift PR @ 335#](https://www.instagram.com/p/CwAvflqJzpK/). So long, 315#. \n\n[Here‚Äôs my press PR @ 145#](https://www.instagram.com/p/CwFcw48pzOf/). And yes, there are dogs in the video. \n\nYou‚Äôve scrolled this far, so here‚Äôs a [vanity pic](https://www.instagram.com/p/Csvnyr7OA0s/) I‚Äôd taken when I started 100 Days of Summer. I don‚Äôt have a post-BTFIB pic. Sorry. \n\n*Weight* - 166 &gt; 173\n\n*All-time PR‚Äôs*\n\n**Bench** - 195 &gt; 195\n\n**Deadlift** - 310 &gt; 335\n\n**Press**- 135 &gt; 145\n\n**What‚Äôs next?**    \nCurrently running Squatober for the 3rd straight year. Then, I‚Äôll run PPSA‚Äôs ‚ÄúBenchamin Franklin‚Äù w/ deads added (the program doesn‚Äôt include deadlifts), hence the name: Benchamin Franklin is Dead, or BFD. Then, it‚Äôs Deadcember, and FINALLY, I‚Äôll run BTM in January.",

        "selfText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background:**\n\nThis was my second meet at 90kg (down from 100), first WRPF meet and first time ever travelling for a meet.  Also as I turn 40 next year, my last year competing as a Sub-master 35-39.\n\n**Prep:**\n\nThis was my first meet where I really had gotten to focus in with my coach Jake Benson and have a lot of prep time to build up for this.  From my last dexa scan done a few years ago vs one week before my meet we had dropped 12lbs of body fat and put on almost 1lb of LBM.  Jake does some \"unconventional\" things compared to other coaches with his programming but I just decided I was going to trust the process and dive in.\n\nSince I'm almost 40, my body just cannot train squats more than once per week under the bar, so we did a ton of conditioning type work and used other methods like plyometric work to focus on better performance on the platform. This was easily the best shape I have ever been in and all of our work payed off.\n\nBench was by far the best feeling lift going into this meet, which is normally the opposite for me.  Prior  meets I had been absolutely destroyed with shoulder/elbow/bicep pain that had a big impact on bench.  I had not PRd bench in almost 3 years.  We focused a lot on all sorts of fatigue/ intensity specific variations that allowed me to not have to work under high loads but still make progress.  It was really weird at first but I knew we were on to something about 8 weeks out when I hit 5kg less than my old max for a double at RPE 7.\n\nMy biggest struggle with deadlift has been just being exhausted by the time DLs roll around.  So again a lot of the conditioning / hypoxia work really benefited me here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Meet:**\n\nI weighed in at 89.0kg and immediately started my rehydration protocols.  I was in the afternoon flight for the first time ever which was miserable for weigh ins, but awesome for the meet day as I could actually sleep the night before not having to be up early.\n\nSquat warmups were a bit hectic, we were competing on Monos but everyone was warming up on combo racks.  I am not used to the mono and so I felt not great about having to squat out of one.  I did choose to walk out because I was not confident in just picking from the mono and going from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Attempts**  [https://www.instagram.com/p/Cxl1Xm6y\\_lU/](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cxl1Xm6y_lU/) here are all my 3rd attempts\n\nSQUAT: 205kg/452lbs ‚úÖ 215kg/474lbs ‚úÖ 222.5kg/491lbs ‚úÖ\n\nMy first 2 attempts I also didn't have the mono at the right height and it was really difficult to get setup under the bar making those attempts harder than they should have been.  The third attempt felt much better at the right height.  I learned I really do not like squatting out of a mono, and Kabuki bars feel not great and want to roll forward on you.\n\nThis was a PR for me at 90kg and a state/national record for my weight/age class.\n\nBENCH: 155kg/342lbs ‚úÖ 167.5kg/369lbs ‚úÖ 175kg/386lbs ‚úÖ\n\nAfter my opener I knew I was going to have a big bench day.  I asked Jake if I could just get my PR on attempt 2 so I went 2.5kg over my all time PR and it flew off the chest.  I was so happy to finally have a PR I didn't really know where to go for the 3rd.  We settled on 175kg which was just 2.5kg under the national record, but knew it should be safe for me to hit.  I smoked it and started laughing halfway up at how easy I got it.\n\nDEADLIFTS:\n\n240kg/529lbs ‚úÖ 255kg/562lbs ‚úÖ 262.5kg/579lbs ‚úÖ\n\nMost I‚Äôve ever done in comp was 260kg so I just wanted to beat that.  I was definitely still feeling fatigue by this point but after hitting 255 knew a PR would be there.  Can't say thanks enough to /u/Sully100 for all your help getting me through deads.\n\nThis was a meet PR for me and a state and national record for my weight/age class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Reflection:** This was by far the most fun meet I have ever had.  The group of guys competing were all amazing and supportive.  The staff was so helpful and going 9/9 with PRs on everything was just the perfect meet.  I set 4 state records and 3 national records ( just missed bench).  I can't wait to do it again next year in the master's division.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext up for me is a real focus on getting my squat back up over my 100kg **BW** total.  I want to get to 450dots and a 700kg total at 90kg, which seems very achievable after this meet.  So we will keep progressing bench and put a real focus on my quads and squat improvements.",

I've done my best to try and look through both internal and external documentation every time this happens, but that costs a ton of time and I always end up just having to go back for more assistance.\n\nI'm not normally like this, with my previous responsibilities I could usually piece things together based on what's already written and code examples/docs/SO, but this ticket and the last few months of similar problems have me on edge.

I'm assuming there may be other companies there that might be willing to be open for CS students even though they're looking for Business majors primarily since my school is popular for Business students.\n\nThe problem is, is there's only 4 companies there specifically for CS internships, there's around over a hundred companies coming to the career fair, but only 4 are listed for CS majors on Handshake. And since CS is extremely competitive, my chances of getting considered are slim to none if there truly is going to only be 4 companies looking for CS majors.\n\nAnd my college's career center does not help you find internships you have to find it yourself, AND I have to pay $1,200 for the internship credit to count to graduate since it's treated as a class, with the school not helping at all with finding internships. Pretty much apply to any and all internship postings and hope I get a call back, at the same time pay the college to do basically nothing for me to find these internships. \n\nDoes anyone know what to do in this situation? I'm stuck here, why am I required to pay $1,200 for the internship to count to graduate when the school doesn't do anything to help me find internships? Shit doesn't make sense\n\nI rather use that $1,200 for a research class as a replacement over internship since that's what my friend did at his school, but that's not an option for mine... And I find it highly unlikely to land an internship by Summer if there really is only going to be 4 companies for CS majors at this career fair. So I might not be able to graduate if I can't get an internship on time by the Summer. \n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention, I live in west Michigan, so this area of Michigan isn't that good for tech jobs in general either way. Relocation is an option but that's only an absolute last resort if I have no other option. I've considered apprenticeships like Revature, Accenture and Genspark but for some reason they've stopped accepting new people this year.\n\nEDIT2: Assuming there's going to be hundreds of CS students here too from other schools, I have to stand out somehow, I don't have any spectacular coding projects to showcase besides a Roblox game I'm running with 4k players playing it, I doubt anyone at the career center will take a Roblox Pokemon game seriously. People want to see useful projects that can benefit their company to make profit or solve their problems, not a video game. I did attend a coding bootcamp last year but the projects we made are the stuff tech people legit make fun of, it's those calculator, to do lists, book search engine projects.",

Hurray right? should be over the moon that I was able to secure something in this shitshow of a marketplace right?\n\nWhat the fuck guys. What the actual fuck is even going on anymore. We've just been assigned our first stories and it's been NOTHING but roadblock after roadblock after fucking roadblock. There was barely any fucking training on how this system works  or how to troubleshoot things when they go wrong or WHAT ANY OF THESE TOOLS EVEN MEAN, my manager barely speaks english and has only been a manager for literally a month and has no idea what the fuck they're even doing half the time when it comes to managing a team. Our first 1:1 was the most awkward fucking experience I've had where I'm literally asking for a clear definition of what our metrics are and what we are going to be evaluated on when our performance review comes, and they literally couldn't even fucking answer that. How in the fuck has this company operated this long?\n\nThe mentor that I was assigned is not even in the same role as I am so half the time when I ask them for help they just say \"hey try pinging x, they might know!\". Everyone is too fucking busy being buried in their own work to help, and I'm just sitting here banging my head against the wall  for hours upon hours with no fucking progress. This isn't even mentioning how this software must have been coded during the industrial revolution because of how fucking outdated it is.\n\nI'm REALLY trying not to have a shitty attitude about work. I really do want to just git gud. I don't want to just be a fucking useless complainer co-worker and do nothing but shit on working at the company, because then I won't fucking improve and I'll be stuck in this loop forever.\n\nPLEASE tell me how I can deal with this better. I know people out there have worked at shitty companies before. Quitting isn't an option because I need the money. I'm approaching my wit's end with this shit.\n\n/rant\n\nedit: fixed the bug we're all good now lol",
